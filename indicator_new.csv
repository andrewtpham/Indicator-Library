Outcome,2.1,Safe disposal of feces,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Child Health & Nutrition,,Feces disposal should be measured with two indicators to ensure comparability with international targets and to obtain programmatically more relevant information. Indicator 1: Proportion of households that disposed of the youngest childâs feces safely the last time s/he passed stool (DHS standard) Indicator 2: Proportion of households that disposed of the youngest childâs feces appropriately the last time s/he passed stool,,Households with children 0-23 months,,N/A (potentially urban/rural),Positive,,,,"Nationally representative household Surveys, including DHS and MICS. Population based KPC Surveys",See FFP Standard Indicators Handbook,Surveys,"Baseline, Midline, Endline",,,,,,,"Passing stool directly into a toilet facility or throwing it into a toilet facility when a potty was used or defecation occurred in the open are the safest disposal methods. If feces are rinsed from clothing, bedding or washable diapers, the water should be discarded in a toilet facility (but not into a composting toilet), or drained into a sewer or septic system. Disposable diapers should not be discarded in a toilet facility, because they will clog drain pipes and do not decompose fully if they contain plastic materials, which could make it impossible to empty the pit of a pit latrine. Disposal of these diapers in the trash that is collected at least once per week could be a relatively safe option, but it may not be available in most developing countries. Therefore the later options are not included in the calculation of Indicator 1. The following response categories are âsafeâ: -  Dropped into toilet facility -  Rinsed/washed away Water discarded into toilet facility (except composting toilet) Water discarded into sink or tub connected to drainage system (sewer, septic tank or pit) -  Disposed Into solid waste/trash with weekly collection (Indicator 2 only) Unsafe disposal: All other options expose the environment to fecal contamination. This includes open grey water pits or garbage pits. Burial of feces seems an unlikely choice for most households, because it is difficult to remove feces routinely from the environment in this manner. The following response categories are âunsafeâ: -  Rinsed/washed away Water discarded into composting toilet Water discarded outside (includes open grey water pits) -  Disposed Into solid waste/trash but no weekly trash collection Somewhere in yard (includes garbage pits) Outside premises -  Buried -  Did nothing/left it there",,,"From DIG Rapid Knowledge, Practices and Coverage (KPC) Survey REVISED MODULE 1A FOR CYCLE 21 GRANTEES: HOUSEHOLD WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND HYGIENE ** Please note this module is currently being updated and revised",,,,,,
Outcome,2.1,Household Water Treatment,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Child Health & Nutrition,,Effective household (also called âpoint-of-useâ) water treatment should be measured with two indicators to ensure comparability with international targets and to obtain programmatically more relevant information.

Although some methods such as chlorination and filtration can protect water for longer than 24 hours, it is assumed that most poor households will not store large quantities of water, but will collect water daily. Where cisterns or roof tanks are common and treated chemically, these questions may need to be adapted to take into account the less frequent treatment of large quantities of water. Where water chlorination is promoted and where it is feasible, household water should be tested for residual chlorine (free and total) using inexpensive test strips. Effective treatment methods are: Boil for at least 1 minute Add bleach/chlorine Water filter (ceramic, sand, composite) Solar disinfection Note: these methods may be used in combination with sedimentation or straining through cloth to remove solid matter and to increase the effectiveness of physical or chemical methods. Methods not effective to threat drinking water, if not used in combination with one above: Let it stand and settle/sedimentation Strain it through cloth Any other method",,,"From DIG Rapid Knowledge, Practices and Coverage (KPC) Survey REVISED MODULE 1A FOR CYCLE 21 GRANTEES: HOUSEHOLD WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND HYGIENE ** Please note this module is currently being updated and revised",,,,,,

Activity,AAP-1,Number of feedback received (including complaints) which have been acted upon,UN OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs),,Emergency Response,Feedback Mechanisms,"Feedback mechanismsÂ provide a means for all those affected to comment on and thus indirectly influence programme planning and implementation (see HAPâs âparticipationâ benchmark). They include focus group discussions, surveys, interviews and meetings on âlessons learntâ with a representative sample of all the affected population (see ECBâs Good Enough Guide for tools and Guidance notes 3-4). The findings and the agencyâs actions in response to feedback should be systematically shared with the affected population. (Sphere Core Standard 1, Guidance Note 2)","Feedback mechanisms can take many forms. Whatever the most appropriate channels are should be used; radio talk back programmes, online surveys, sms and twitter inputs, regularised focus group discussions with selected members of the population, suggestions and complaints boxes, designation of sector or camp committees to feedback on specific topics, prioritisation assessments, through dedicated community engagement staff among many other possibilities. Sex, age, ability or other relevant diversity disaggregation of the feedback received is important in order to understand who is most at risk and to take responsible actions. It is important to remember that feedback needs to be collected, digested and acted upon, and then the results of those actions relayed to the population, then another round of feedback can begin on the changed situation. This is the 'feedback loop' - an ongoing dialogue between the humanitarian community and the affected population. Remember that much of this is already happening - through food monitors, community outreach programmes, ongoing assessments - the important thing is to keep the feedback loop continuing.",Institution,Number,,,,,,"HAP Benchmark 3 on Sharing information, Sphere Core Standard 1: People-centered humanitarian response, The Good Enough Guide - Section 5: Use feedback to improve project impact",,Reviews of Official Records,not available,,Number of organisations with formal feedback mechanisms in place,,,,,,,,"- Clusters and partners have a formal, appropriate feedback mechanism in place that is discussed and agreed with key stakeholders and publicly communicated.  - The feedback mechanism employed is appropriate and robust enough to deal with (communicate, receive, process, respond to and learn from) complaints.  - Clusters and Lead Agencies/Advisory Groups (SAG) have oversight of feedback (incl. complaints) mechanism and learn from and react to information received.",,Yes,,,,

Information can reduce anxiety and is an essential foundation of community responsibility and ownership. At a minimum, clusters and agencies should provide a description of the cluster's role and responsibilities, agencyâs mandate and project(s), the populationâs entitlements and rights, and when and where to access assistance (see HAPâs âsharing informationâ benchmark). (Sphere Core Standard 1, Guidance Note 4) Possible examples:","Common ways of sharing information include noticeboards, public meetings, schools, newspapers, SMS 'blasts', FAQ flyers or radio and TV broadcasts. The information should demonstrate considered understanding of peopleâs situations and be conveyed in local language(s), using a variety of adapted media so that it is accessible to all those concerned. For example, use spoken communications or pictures for children and adults who cannot read, use uncomplicated language (i.e. understandable to local 12-year-old) and employ a large typeface when printing information for people with visual impairments.

Activity,AAP-3,Number of persons consulted (disaggregated by sex/age) before designing a program/project [alternatively: while implementing the program/project],UN OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs),,Emergency Response,Participation,"Participation in design of assessments, programmes, evaluations etc, means that a selected segment(s) of the affected populaiton have a direct influence on decision making. Â Measures should be taken to ensure the participation of members of all groups of affected people - young and old, men and women. Special efforts should be made to include people who are not well represented, are marginalised (e.g. by ethnicity or religion) or otherwise âinvisibleâ (e.g. housebound or in an institution).","Understanding and addressing the barriers to participation faced by different people is critical to balanced participation. How a cluster or organisation enables key stakeholders to play an active role in the decision-making processes that affect them. It is unrealistic to expect an organisation to engage with all stakeholders over all decisions all of the time. Therefore the organisation must have clear guidelines (and practices) enabling it to prioritize stakeholders appropriately and to be responsive to the differences in power between them. Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that the most marginalized and affected are represented and have influence. Participation here also encompasses the processes through which an organisation or cluster monitors and reviews its progress and results against goals and objectives; feeds learning back into the organisation on an on-going basis; and reports on the results of the process. To increase accountability to stakeholders, goals and objectives must be also designed in consultation with those stakeholders. A well known example of participation in developing indicators is the WASH indicator developed by a community which was - ""# of hours girls spend in school"" - highlighting the importance of education to the community, and also that improved water access had improved education possibilities. So the indicator has a measurement of impact built into it, the improved water access as an outcome can be assumed.",Institution,Number,,,,,,"HAP Benchmark 4 on Participation, Sphere Core Standard 1: People-centered humanitarian response, The Good Enough Guide - Tool 3: How to involve people throughout the project",,Reviews of Official Records,not available,,number of persons consulted,,,,,,,,"- Organisations document how it speaks with a balanced cross-section of representatives from the affected communities.  - Agency has a verifiable record of how communities (or their representatives) are demonstrably involved and influential in decision-making, implementation and judgement of impact throughout the lifetime of a project. - Agency has mechanisms in place to monitor and evaluate outcomes and impact and these are reported against (incl. to affected communities).  - Cluster has a verifiable record of how it identified interest groups in the affected communities, and the power relationships that exist.",,Yes,,,,

It is a measure of a health system?s ability to provide adequate care for pregnant women during labour and delivery.,"Calculation: Numerator: A skilled birth attendant is an accredited health professional ? such as a midwife, doctor or nurse ? who has been educated and trained to proficiency in the skills needed to manage normal (uncomplicated) pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and in the identification, management and referral of complications in women and newborns. Traditional birth attendants, trained or not, are excluded from the category of skilled attendant at delivery. Denominator should be calculated by using the fertility rate by age class and region (e.g. obtained via demographic and health surveys). In Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, the expected proportion of births is between 4 and 5 % of the total population. Alternatively, percentage of births assisted by a skilled attendant can be assessed through household surveys where the numerator is the number of reported deliveries over a certain period of time assisted by a skilled attendant and the denominator is the reported number of births over the same period of time. Interpretation: This indicator can serve as a proxy for monitoring progress in the health response. Limitations: the indicator may not sufficiently capture women?s access to high quality care, particularly when complications arise. It also does not provide information on availability of any supplies and equipment a skilled attendant may need. Both administrative and household survey methods have limitations. The calculation of the number of births from administrative population number and fertility rates can be very imprecise.

Where viable, this should be incorporated into the M&E design of the project. However, this data may not be available for all projects. Where poverty data is available, numbers of poor people should be determined by a poverty metric relevant to that country (e.g. numbers below a countryâs national poverty line, community poverty assessment, first quintile income levels) rather than necessarily the international $1.25/day definition. This could be gathered using country level data or more sub-national level data. Whichever metric is used in the project should be stated in the return. Given all ICF projects happen in developing countries, this is used as a proxy that we are reaching the poor. There are limitations to this proxy as many countries in which the ICF works are unequal.-- Children The total number of individuals as calculated includes children. Children benefit from clean energy access at the household level as it enables them to e.g. do theirhomework. The other benefit from clean energy is in terms of health - indoor air pollution from cook stoves using dirty fuel is responsible for the deaths of 2 million women, girls and children under 5 (WHO/UNDP methodology, 2009). Women and children often suffer disproportionately from the effects of indoor air pollution and spend more time collecting fire wood.  On-grid It is not possible to disaggregate grid electricity by source (clean vs. fossil). Furthermore, providing energy to the grid ...(look into URL) translate into access as new connections would need to be established simultaneously. This indicator therefore excludes on-grid energy. Any measurements of energy access are likely to be conservative and be a subset of results as improved access to the grid cannot be measured. Instead, the indicator to be examined should be âinstalled capacity of clean energyâ which is also a priority indicator for the ICF. ",,DFID provides X number of households with solarcl anterns. Household surveys through project M&E will iden ify the number of new households who have access to clean energy due to the ICF project compared to the initial baseline and forecast of those who would have bought solar lanterns anyway. Ideally the project level data will also be disaggregated by income level. X is then multiplied by the average household size as set out in the census or national household survey.,,,,https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540029/Access-clean-energy24.pdf,,
No level,,Number of people with access to financial services as a result of DFID support,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Financial services,,"This is a widely accepted indicator of financial access amongst the international development community, including the G-20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion. The indicator measures access to financial services rather than a direct measure of poverty. Evidence1 shows that improving access to finance can raise incomes and help support people to work their way out of poverty. DFIDâs spending departments and Country Offices are encouraged to supplement this with other indicators within project logframes to measure different aspects e.g. usage, quality and cost of products, and financial capability and literacy in their programmes to support financial sector development. The indicator includes number of individuals reached with financial services (e.g. credit, savings/deposits, insurance, leasing, and transfer payments etc.). Access is defined in terms of ownership of an account at a formal financial institution (e.g. a bank, credit union, co-operative, post office, and microfinance institution). The account can be used to save money, to make or receive payments, or to receive wages and remittances. It also includes those who are provided with access to a debit or ATM card. The indicator covers outreach of financial services to individuals only. DFID is focusing hard on the needs of small businesses in thinking about our policy and programme priorities, because small businesses have a vital role in development through their contribution to economic growth, wealth creation and employment. Therefore it is important to measure impact of DFID programmes on access at two levels - individuals and businesses. . The data reported covers access across the type of products (e.g. deposits, credit, and insurance) and type of institutions delivering the products (formal, commercial banks, specialised state financial institutions, microfinance institutions, cooperatives and credit unions etc). For the purpose of overall corporate reporting, data is collected on the number of people supported under DFID funded programmes to gain access to either one or a range of financial services. However for the purposes of project monitoring and evaluation more detail disaggregation of both types of financial services and types of financial institutions may be desirable in understanding the breadth and depth of financial sector development in a country/region. Access to financial services = access made possible directly under DFID supported programme (e.g. micro credit to small borrowers from MFIs and banks supported by DFID programme) + nationwide expansion in access to financial services resulting from the policy changes and improvements in the enabling environment made possible through DFID support. Data will focus on bilateral activities. In the case of multi-donor funded programmes, data attributable to DFID should be calculated on the basis of DFIDâs share in the total programme cost. DFID staff time should not be included in the calculation of DFID cost. In the case of programmes funded by DFID e.g. through trust fund arrangements with multilateral or regional institutions such asIFC, IFAD, AsDB etc.), results should be reported against DFID share in the total cost of the programme. In case DFID happens to be the only funder of programmes implemented by a multilateral institution, this should be explicitly mentionedin the report so that care can be taken at the central level to avoid any possibledouble counting. ","The realisation that financial inclusion is a key enabling element, both in the fight against poverty and in reaching the goal of inclusive economic development, is leading to an increasing focus on financial inclusion policies and initiatives. Financial access is a critical first step towards inclusive financial systems. Access to financial services can make a positive difference in the lives of the poor. Broad -based wealth and asset creation is a priority for DFID. Given that access to finance is a cross -cutting instrument, data on progress on financial inclusion is important to monitor our direct and indirect impact on MDG1. The inclusion of gender disaggregated statistics reflects DFIDâs focus on women empowerment under pillar 5 of the Economic Development Strategy Framework and DFIDâs Strategic Vision for Economic Empowerment of Women and Girls. It also indirectly monitors our impact on MDG3.","Number of people with access to financial services per year, disaggregated by sex. Country Office/Spending Department Variation: Cumulative",,"Mandatory: by Sex. Additional: by country. The data systems of most financial institutions are not designed to specifically track and report access to financial services. Every effort should be made to engAgewith financial institutions provided with support from DFID programmes to help them put arrangements in place to collect and report Gender disaggregated data. But such effort will take time and will be cost intensive which may not be cost effective for relatively small programmes. In such cases, sample surveys could be commissioned to get an informed sense of the Gender outreach.","An increase in this indicator will show that an increasing number of people have improved access to clean energy as a results of DFID support. Although this indicator should be reliable in terms of the number of people reached, it is not currently possible to disaggregate the degree of improvement in access experienced, or its longer term sustainability","Baseline should be developed as a part of the Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) arrangements for projects and programmes supported by DFID.

Country offices will report data and be explicit about what they are measuring and to what extent it fits the definitions set out above. They will be explicit about the regressions used to evaluate survey data and the assumptions used in any estimates and their basis for attribution to DFID. Country offices will be explicit about the specifications of any models, assumptions used in any estimates and the origin of data not collected or calculated by DFID. Country offices will ensure that impact and progress claimed under DFID supported programmes are clearly attributable to DFID inputs in the sense that there is a clear and unambiguous link between DFID inputs and the programme outputs, and the impact the programme outputs have in delivering the expansion in financial access claimed under the DFID supported programme. Where DFID is one of the many contributors to the progress, impact data should be attributed to DFID based on DFIDâs share in the total programme spend and/or programme inputs. Where survey data is used, Country Offices and spending departments should consider the estimated margin of error in the data reported. Country offices collect and calculate all estimates for their programme. Investment and Finance Team (IFT) will provide advice and QA to country offices, and aggregate country-level data to produce the final estimate.","A widely accepted formula of financial access is one where the entire adult population is broken in to three groups: (A) those who have access to and use financial services; (B) those who have access but do not use it and; (C) those that do not have access. Financial access is defined as A+B. In calculating the number of people reached with financial services, focus would be on number of credit accounts or number of savings accounts or insurance etc held by individuals. Adding up the numbers across all services will be erroneous as the same person may be holding a deposit account, insurance and credit account. It is possible for a person to hold more than one deposit or credit account. Therefore, data would be disaggregated by product type and would be collected in terms of individuals holding the accounts. Access beyond any one particular financial service is a good indicator of the depth of the financial markets.","This indicator is relevant to DFIDâs commitment to provide more than 50 million people with the means to help work their way out of poverty. The indicator is not a direct measure of the number of people working their way out of poverty but rather a measure of access to financial services (eg credit, savings/deposits, insurance, leasing, and transfer payments). Evidence shows that broad based asset and wealth creation through improved access to financial services can raise incomes and help support people to work their way out of poverty. 21 Country Offices and DFIDâs Private Sector Department (PSD) contribute data for this indicator. Data is drawn from a wide variety of sources depending upon the programme. This can include: management information system data; national statistics published by the relevant country; international datasets; other governmental systems such as central banks official agency surveys and data gathered by association of network of microfinance institutions and in some cases specifically commissioned financial access surveys. The three main contributors are DFID Kenya, DFID Nigeria and PSD. In Kenya data is collected by a nationally representative survey which conforms to DFIDâs methodological standards for such surveys. In Nigeria estimates are collected by a household survey; the survey is nationally representative, with a sample of over 20,000 and follows FinScope methodology. Data for PSD is collected by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorâs (CGAP) Financial Access dataset and is quality assured and vetted by an independent Monitoring and Evaluation agency commissioned under the programme. The timeliness of the data varies and in some cases where data is sourced from financial access surveys there may be lags of 12 months or more. However generally data tends to be reported on an annual basis. There are no concerns in regards to the burden imposed on data suppliers and confidentiality.",Two years after intervention.,"Ensure that where data is quoted from other national and international published sources, assurances are sought regarding the data quality and confirmation that the sources are internationally reputable.

Central quality assurance within DFID is carried out by the Investment and Finance Team and Private Sector Department (with support from statisticians and economistsâ cadre) as well as by the Finance and Corporate Performance Department This is a measure of financial access rather than poverty reduction. This Output level indicator is relevant for measuring DFIDâs public commitment to help 50 million poor people with access to financial services. It gives a broad indication of the reach of DFIDâs financial sector development programmes. The majority 60% of the commitment is achieved through one global programme that supports technology enabled distribution of financial services e.g. mobile phone banking. Results of outreach to poor clients under this programme are estimated through representative sample surveys and expected to be reasonably accurate. Access to financial services is expected to enhance the welfare of the poor households by helping them to smooth consumption, save and invest in enterprise and withstand shocks. However, the impact of access to financial services on poor peopleâs live is a subject matter of evaluation rather than more frequent and periodic reporting of results over the life of a programme.",Double counting remains a big challenge to be addressed - both across product types and product suppliers.

No level,,Number of women and girls with improved access to security and/or improved access to justice services through DFID support,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Governance,,"This indicator provides an aggregate of the additional numbers of women and girls with improved access to security and justice over the four year reporting period. Number The reporting unit is the number of unique beneficiaries. In all cases country offices should take care to avoid double counting. Targets and results should only be cumulative (adding beneficiaries from each year to get a grand total) if country offices can demonstrate that beneficiaries are different individuals from year to year (i.e., the programme targets nonoverlapping geographical areas in different years). Otherwise, targets will be peak-year, and results will also be peak year (the single year with the greatest number of beneficiaries). Women and Girls The term covers all female beneficiaries regardless of age. In practice certain methodologies, e.g. perception surveys or government data sources, may offer data on a subset of girls over the age of consent or of women up to a certain age (15-60); in these cases only the data for the subset should be recorded. Note that it may be possible to collect data indirectly on girls younger than the age of consent, such as through interviews asking parents whether their younger children accompanied them to a shelter or through administrative records of specific kinds of justice programmes, such as child custody hearings. To avoid double-counting, male beneficiaries should not be included in the DRF results, even if women and girls might indirectly benefit from programming they have received. Improved To promote consistency in reporting and to avoid double counting of participants, the term âimproveâ is taken either to mean: -  to offer new or substantially improved access to security and/or justice services or -  to add beneficiaries to existing programmes which aim to improve access to security and/or to justice services. Countries should report only the number of people accessing a new or substantially improved programme/services or the additional number of people with access to existing security and justice programmes/services. In either case, for the purposes of the DRF, it is assumed that these programmes are of acceptable quality as to constitute an improvement to its participants, i.e. that the Business Case provides evidence that the benefits of the programme outweigh its costs and that participants are legitimately counted as beneficiaries. The point here is that the indicator measures numbers of people benefitting from new or fundamentally improved services, and not light-touch improvement in the quality of existing services. Country offices are encouraged to include separate measures of the quality of services provided in their logframes and programme assessments, but the qualitative element is not directly addressed in this indicator. Access Access is measured by a number of proxy indicators, as set out in the methodology section below. Security and Justice Securityâ and âjusticeâ are not terms with universally accepted definitions. Security includes personal security, individual safety, security of assets etc. Access to security might involve accessing a service (e.g. gender responsive police unit) or it might involve a broader range of interventions to address the causes of women and girlsâ insecurity (e.g. cultural drivers of insecurity, empowerment etc). Justice services include the provision of punishment, arbitration, restitution, retribution, rehabilitation and/or reconciliation. As such, it is possible that a broad range of DFID programmes may contribute to this target. Relevant programmes which aim to improve women and girlsâ access to security and access to justice services may include, but are not limited to, programmes designed to: -  improve formal (both civil and criminal) or informal systems of justice - may include work with paralegals and other providers of legal and dispute resolution services. -  provide support to all parts of the criminal justice system including police, prosecutors, courts and prisons - may include increased recruitment of (female) police officers, building capacities for gender-responsive policing and the establishment of gender based violence units within the police. -  support for alternative dispute resolution. -  prevent, manage or resolve conflict and/or crime. -  prevent and respond to violence against women and girls - may include harmful traditional practices such as Female Genital Cutting. -  improve individual and community safety - may include a variety of projects such as the provision of street lighting. -  empower women to claim and enforce their rights - may include land rights, inheritance and dowry-related issues. -  tackle the cultural drivers which prevent women and girls from accessing security and accessing justice services. Given the breadth of security and justice programming, in-country advisors should contact CHASE (Macha Farrant) to discuss the inclusion of their programmesâ results in this indicator. Through DFID Support Data will be provided by DFID country office advisers working on programmes which aim to improve women and girlsâ access to security and access to justice services. This indicator is attributable to DFID, so includes only those women and girls who have benefitted from DFID bilateral programming. Where programmes are funded by more than one donor or through multilaterals funded by country offices, country offices will provide a % calculation of proportionate DFID share.","This indicator provides data about one area of DFID governance programming, in a field of priority to DFID Ministers.","Number of women and girls with improved access to security and justice services through DFID support per year, disaggregated by sex wherever possible",,"Sex, and may also include: Region, Age",,N/A - 2011 is first calculation.,,"This indicator provides data about one area of DFID governance programming, in a field of priority to DFID Ministers.","e Wide variety of sources, depending on country context.

The result is 43percentage of the number of women and girls in areas in which the DFID programme is active. Methodology 2 It is estimated that 1 in 3 women in between ages 15 and 40 in Kenya are forced into sexual intercourse at least once. A survey of the provinces in which DFID is working indicates that 16percentage of women who were forced into having sexual intercourse sought help either through the police or traditional systems.

No level,,Number of people benefiting from DFID-supported cash transfer programmes,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Financial services,,"Whatâs included - programme types This includes all regular cash transfer payments made to individuals and households to tackle poverty and vulnerability. The indicator includes: ï§ Child grants. For the purposes of this indicator, a child is anyone up to the age of 18 years (the definition in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child). In practice, most child transfer programmes in low income countries in which DFID works will be restricted to younger children, with the intention of improving their nutrition and access to healthcare in the critical first few years of life. Typically, this means that children are eligible up to five years old (60 months); in some cases, it may be restricted to up to two years (24 months). Reflecting better understanding of early childhood development, an increasing number of schemes extend eligibility for a child grant earlier, so that it is received by a woman in the last six months of pregnancy through to the childâs second birthday. In these cases, transfers to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers are included as child grants. ï§ Social (i.e. non-contributory) pensions. The definition of who receives a pension varies from country to country: in Low Income Countries (LICs), social pensions are often introduced for the oldest (e.g., those over 70 years), with eligibility age brought down over time (e.g. to 65) as more funds become available. ï§ Those receiving wages from employment on public works schemes. These transfers are the hardest to measure for coverage: work is often short term, casual (on a daily basis) and with uptake varying considerably within and between years (often peaking in agricultural slack season - typically before the main harvest - and in years of poor harvests or other shocks to the economy and employment). ï§ Other transfers. To poor households and particular vulnerable categories of people (e.g. disability grants; targeted payments to poor households; universal basic income grants). Whatâs not included? It does not include transfers of one-off payments or assets; or transfers to communities. It does not include cash transfers funded out of humanitarian budget lines. Unit of measurement The unit of measurement for this indicator is the individual. It is assumed for the purposes of this indicator that all individuals residing in a household receiving a transfer benefit from the transfer, and therefore count as beneficiaries, even if the transfer is provided in principle specifically for a given individual (e.g. a child or 2 elderly person) within the household. So, if a child grant is provided to a household with five members, this counts as five beneficiaries. Some categorical transfers are provided per individual: so, if a household of five people contains one child under five, they receive (for example) Â£25 per month, while another household with two children under five (and a total of five members) receives Â£50. In both cases, however, the number of beneficiaries would be simply the number of household members, and so would be the same (five) for both: this number would not be doubled for the household receiving Â£50. Similarly, if a household receives two different types of cash transfer (for example, a child grant and an old age pension; or a child grant and income from public works wages) the members of that household should only be counted once. So: to report this indicator, country offices need: ï§ Know how many people are in households receiving DFID-supported cash transfers ï§ Avoid double-counting households that receive two DFID-supported transfers, either of the same type of transfer (e.g. two child grants) or different types (e.g. a child grant and a pension). How this is achieved will depend on the situation and the quality of data available. 1. DFID is supporting just one programme; each household can receive just one transfer 1a. If the programme management information system (MIS) can supply data on actual numbers of people in households receiving the transfer, this total is the number to be reported. 1b. If the MIS cannot supply this data, multiply the number of recipient households by the average household size. For average household size, use a figure that matches as closely as possible to the characteristics of the recipient population i.e. if the scheme is for rural households in a particular province, try to obtain survey data on the average household size for this section of the population. This may be obtained from a recent census, a survey conducted during programme design or targeting, a programme evaluation survey or a national sample survey. See Worked Example 1 for guidance. 2. DFID is supporting just one programme; a household can receive more than one transfer from this programme 2a. As above, if the MIS can supply data on actual numbers of people in recipient households, this total is the number to be reported. Households receiving two transfers (e.g. for two children or two older people) are treated exactly the same as households receiving only one transfer: the people in these households are each counted once, not twice. 2b. If the MIS is not able to supply the number of people in households that receive the transfer, but is able to supply the number of households, then estimate the number of beneficiaries as in 1b above. 2c. If the MIS can only supply the number of transfers (i.e. the number of individual recipients), then it will be necessary to first estimate the number of individuals. This is an unlikely scenario - most schemes will record a recipient household - but conceivable, if the household data is only used at the local level, and all that is passed up to the centre is the total number of transfers made. In this case, it will be necessary to (i) estimate the number of households from the number of transfers (using census or survey data to find the average number of eligible individuals in households with at least one eligible individual) and then (ii) estimate the number of people in recipient households. So: if the transfer is for children under five years: ï§ pull out from census or survey data those households which have at least one child under five years; ï§ find the average number of children under five in these households (probably something like 1.4: of households with at least one child under five, many households will have one child under five, quite a few will have two, some willhave three, a very few will have fourâ¦)  ï§ divide the total number of transfers by the average number of children per eligible household in order to obtain an estimate of the number of recipient households ï§ multiply this by the average household size for eligible households to obtain an estimate of the number of people in households receiving these transfers (i.e., the number of beneficiaries) Again, use an average that reflects as closely as possible the characteristics (geographical, rural or urban, quintile of the income or consumption distribution, etc) of the recipient population. See Worked Example 2 for guidance. 3. DFID is supporting more than one programme; there is no overlap between programmes Calculate estimated number of beneficiaries for each programme separately; add together to obtain a total return for the country. This may be possible if, for example, the two programmes operate in different parts of the country. For each programme, estimate the number of beneficiaries as outlined in 1 or 2 above. 4. DFID is supporting more than one programme; there is potential for households to receive transfers from more than one programme 4a. There is a single registry which serves all programmes and records how many people are in households receiving transfers. In this case, the database can supply information on the total number of people in households receiving one or more transfers at a given reporting point. This number is reported in the return. 4b. There is no single registry i.e. programme-specific MIS can supply information (ranging from basic to sophisticated) about the recipients of each transfer programme separately, but not in relation to each other. In this situation, the country office will need to estimate the degree of overlap (that is, the number of people in households receiving two or more types of transfer). This is complicated because the average size of households receiving 2+ types of transfers may be different from the average size of household for those receiving just one type of transfer: as a starting point, it might be assumed that these households receiving 2+ transfers are bigger. In the short term, it will be necessary to use (and possibly to collect) survey data in order to estimate the number and size of households receiving two or more transfers. The sampling frame for this survey will probably be quite complex (and would almost certainly be seeking to answer other questions than simply which households received two or more transfers): consult a statistician for expert advice. If done well, such a survey will tell you what percentage of households receive transfer A only; what percentage receive transfer B only; and what percentage receive both transfer A and transfer B. See Worked Example 3 for guidance. If DFID is supporting two or more programmes in the same country, serious consideration should be give to integrating their management information systems. In other words, the medium- to long-term solution to a lack of a single registry is to support the development of one as soon as possible. When it is counted Country offices will be asked to update results information at two points in the year -March and September. Since different types of cash transfer differ in the degree to which they fluctuate in coverage over the course of a year, they will require somewhat different treatment. ï§ For those payments - such as child, pension or disability payments - that are regular (e.g. monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly), country offices should report for set points in the year. For convenience, we propose that for the March corporate reporting figures, country offices report the numbers of those receiving the transfer in December (for monthly payments) or in the last payment round before December (for quarterly payments); and for the September reporting round, country offices collate and submit coverage numbers for those receiving the transfer in June (or immediately before June for transfers made on a quarterly basis). If all country offices report coverage at these two points in the year, this will hopefully allow collation of figures in time for reporting of DFID-wide coverage in March and September. ï§ For payments which are strongly seasonal, and where this peak season may fall in different calendar months in different countries (as is the case with public works programmes), country offices should report the number of beneficiaries over the preceding year. So, for DFID corporate reporting in Worked example 3 DFID supports a child grant programme which reaches 25,000 households. It also supports a social pension programme which reaches 15,000 households. (Both these figures come from the respective programmes MIS.) A survey reveals that 10% of households receiving the child grant also receive the pension. The survey also provides average household sizes for (i) households receiving just the child grant (ii) households receiving just the pension and (iii) households receiving both. row number of Household average household size (from survey) recipients 1 Households receiving child grant (from MIS) 25,000 2 of which: 10% of Households receive the child grant and the pension (from survey)  2,500 5.9 14,750 3 Households receiving child transfer only (row 1 minus row 2)  22,500 5.1 114,750 4 Households receiving pension (from MIS) 15,000 5 of which Households receiving both the pension and the child grant (= row 2) 2,500 6 Households receiving pension only (= row 4 minus row 5)  12,500 3.2 40,000 total 154,750  6 March, country offices should report the peak monthly coverage over the period January to December; for the September corporate reporting round, they should report the highest monthly figure for the period July to June. Annual coverage figures cannot be aggregated over successive years Coverage figures should not be aggregated to provide a figure for total numbers of beneficiaries reached over a period of years. This is because a large proportion of those reached in year three will also have been reached in years one and two. Aggregating multi-year totals would thus dramatically over-count the number of recipients and beneficiaries. (With good MIS in place in all programmes, it should be possible to follow unique cases, track those coming onto or exiting the programme, and so calculate multi-year totals: but this will require a sophisticated MIS and/or considerable analytical effort. ","Over the last 15 years, there has been a dramatic expansion of cash transfer programmes in the developing world. These include social (that is, non-contributory)old age pensions; child grants; public works programmes that provide a (low) daily wage for employment building or improving local infrastructure; and other grants. Good monitoring and evaluation, including experimental or quasi-experimental impact evaluation, has proven that well-designed cash transfers can have significant impact on a number of development outcomes including the depth and incidence of poverty, use of basic services (school enrolment, immunisation rates), food intake and nutrition outcomes (improved child heights). DFIDâs 2011 literature review summarises the evidence on different types of impact and design choices and provides links to other sources. Cash transfers thus have the potential to contribute to DFID priorities including reaching the very poorest, improving nutrition and human development outcomes, and increasing opportunities for girls and women.","The number of people benefitting from DFID-supported cash transfer programmes per year Where possible, and with caveats on interpretation, beneficiary numbers should be disaggregated by sex. (See below for guidance on what to report and when this is and isnât possible.) Country offices should also include notes on any additional information they think necessary to provide context for the interpretation of the figures. In addition, each programme should have information on the following at country level: ï§ Total programme beneficiaries ï§ DFID funding as a percentage of total programme cost 13 Over time, country offices should seek to develop more sophisticated beneficiary incidence and impact analysis. This may involve engaging with the national statistical office and those donors (World Bank, UNICEF, UNFPA, etc) who support household surveys; and/or check with the World Bank Social Protection Atlas which is still in development but should over time provide a repository of survey-based data on transfer coverage and how it relates to household characteristics (poverty status, wealth quintile, geographic or urban-rural location, etc). Such analysis is not feasible or required for the routine twice-yearly reporting, but should be included when new information makes an update possible in the next return. Type of indicator: Peak Year Country Office/Spending department variation: Bangladesh - cumulative results reported.",,"Spatial disaggregation While it will probably not be needed for Operational Planning purposes, MIS data can potentially supply data disaggregated down to the lowest administrative level at which the programme is administered and for which coverAgedata is recorded. In principle, many MIS systems will aggregate at each level of reporting, which can make it time-consuming to obtain this level of disaggregated data from the capital (or UK). If every reporting administrative unit is coded as either rural or urban, it should be possible to estimate coverAgetotals for these different environments. In some cases, particularly during rapid urbanisation, administrative classifications may become outdated, and a proportion of those reported as rural may in fact be urban. Some schemes are also explicitly designed as either rural or urban. A rural-urban breakdown would be useful for country level, but would not be required for headline reporting. Disaggregation by Sex Where possible the Sex of beneficiaries should be reported. That is, out of the total number of DFID-supported beneficiaries, how many are male and how many are female. This may be available from the MIS data on the household composition of transferrecipient households. Some programmes may however record only the number of people in a recipient household, and not their breakdown by Sex. In these cases, Sex disaggregation may be estimated if averAgemale-female household composition is available from other sources (e.g. census or household surveys). When possible (e.g. for child grants, pensions or public works wAges), the Sex of recipients should be recorded and aggregated at country level. Some transfers (especially child grants and conditional cash transfers) are paid to the adult woman in the household as a matter of general principle (based on an argument - and some evidence - that this provides the woman with somewhat greater say in how household money is used, and that this results in more productive spending patterns). If this is the case, it is worth noting this operational principle in the return, but the fact that the woman is designated to receive a transfer on behalf of the children or the household in general should not lead to a report that 90% plus of beneficiaries are female. The assumption that the named recipient is the sole or primary beneficiary cannot be justified (and in the case of child grants may not even be what is intended). In all cases, Sex disaggregation should be provided and used with caution. Experience shows that households should be regarded as, to a significant degree, black boxes, given that cash transferred for one individual may then be used for collective household needs or transferred within the household to meet the needs of another individual. A well known example is that of pensioners in southern Africa, who spend much of their pension on schooling-related costs for their grandchildren. The reason for collecting data on the Sex of the (nominal) recipient is simply to monitor access and check that there are not barriers (perhaps social norms relating to Gender roles or perceptions of shame) that prevent some categories of individuals from claiming transfers to which they are entitled. The reason for monitoring the Sex of nominal recipients is thus simply to ensure that families are claiming for girl as well as boy children, that women as well as men are able to participate in public works programmes, and that elderly women as well as elderly men are able to claim pensions. DFID should be very careful about claiming that these figures represent actual patterns of benefit. ",,"By 2013-14, 6.6 million people had benefited from DFID-supported cash transfer programmes.",,"At a fundamental level, an increase in DFID-supported cash transfer beneficiaries would indicate DFID success in extending transfers to households to help them escape and stay out of poverty. Further data and analysis would be required to (i) establish that these transfers are reaching the poor and vulnerable (beneficiary incidence analysis); and (ii) measure outcomes/impact, and establish that this could be attributed to the transfers (impact assessment e.g. using randomised control trials). At some point in the future, it might be hoped that a decrease in DFID-supported coverage indicated that inclusive economic growth was resulting in fewer households in poverty and in need of transfers. In practice, however, declining total coverage is unlikely: governmentsâ expectations of the rate at which households might âgraduateâ from poverty and transfer eligibility have been unrealistic and experience suggests that cash transfer programmes are expanded (and become more sophisticated and effective) as countries move from low to middle income status. (Mexico and Brazil now reach between a quarter and a third of their populations with conditional cash transfer programmes which are seen as highly effective, including in getting poor children into health programmes and schools). And for transfer programmes that are designed to provide rapid response to protect households from a crisis-induced upswing in poverty and vulnerability (e.g. some public works programmes), both a secular decline in coverage during good years and a dramatic increase in coverage following a crisis would, in different ways, be indicators of success. Finally, a decrease in cash transfers provided by DFID might be a sign of progress if total coverage remained adequate (static or rising) but increasingly financed by the national government in the partner country rather than a donor such as DFID. In this case, it would obviously be wrong to interpret declining DFID-attributable coverage as failure. When DFID-attributable counts are going down but total beneficiary counts are increasing, this should be noted in the return.","Data on number of transfers made Numbers of transfers and recipients (individuals or households receiving the transfer) will be recorded through administrative systems associated with the implementation of the programme (i.e. the programme Management Information System or MIS). The programme should generate regular (monthly, quarterly, annual) reports using MIS data. The reliability of MIS figures should be strengthened by implementation of outreach / public information strategies (so that intended beneficiaries know that they are entitled to a grant) and grievance mechanisms (so those who are not targeted or those do not receive their grant can raise the problem); and by periodic audits and spot checks. When cash transfer programmes operate at large scale, country office staff should explore the possibility of including questions about receipt of these transfers in any major national sample Surveys (see below). This will require conversations with the Ministry or Ministries involved in programme implementation and monitoring and with the national Central Statistical Office (CSO). While each of these Surveys typically is conducted only every three to five years, they will provide a further periodic crosscheck on the coverage data supplied by the MIS; and, by cross-referencing against other household information collected by these Surveys (level and sources of income, food and total consumption, household assets, and so on), will also allow monitoring and evaluation of other aspects of programme performance (e.g. beneficiary incidence analysis to assess targeting). Data on (i) average household size and (ii) average number of intended beneficiaries (e.g. children or elderly) per household To estimate number of beneficiaries, it is necessary to know the number of people in households receiving a transfer. This should normally be available from the programme. In some cases, however, the programme records only the number of individuals or households receiving transfers. When a household may receive two grants under the same programme (e.g. a household with two eligible children receives two child grants), it is possible that the programme reports only the number of transfers. In the first case (one transfer per household), it will be necessary to obtain an estimate of the average number of people in transfer-recipient households; in the latter case (where some households receive two or more transfers, so the number of transfers cannot be taken as the number of households), it will be necessary to obtain an estimate of both the average household size and the average number of grants per recipient household in order to estimate the number of beneficiaries (see 2c above). Ideally, the programme MIS will collect data on the number of people in recipient households. If it does not, and records only the number of recipient households or the number of individual transfers, then country offices can use a household Survey or census to obtain estimates of household size and, if relevant, the average number of eligible individuals per recipient household (for transfers made on a per capita rather than household flat-rate basis). ï§ It may make sense to conduct a sample Survey of transfer recipient households. Such a Survey would obviously be useful for gathering a variety of data on the characteristics of recipient households (not just household size), and 8 may already be scheduled at baseline and regular intervals thereafter as part of programme monitoring and evaluation. ï§ If for any reason it is not possible to collect programme-specific Survey data which would yield an estimate of household size, it might be possible to obtain an estimate of the average number of people per household from an existing or planned national, general purpose representative household Survey such as a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) or Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). The national statistical office and/or UNFPA (the United Nations Population Fund) country office may be the best source for this figure. The figure used should be derived from that part of the population that most closely approximates the characteristics of the recipient population. So, if transfers go only to rural households, the average household size for rural households should be used (this may be larger or smaller than the average for urban households, and thus from the national average). If transfers go only to poor rural households in a particular province or region of the country, staff should seek to obtain a Survey-based estimate for the size of rural households in the first and second quintiles of these provinces - if possible. If there are two or more transfer programmes, especially if they operate in overlapping areas (raising the possibility that some households receive transfers from more than one programme), it is desirable that there is a single registry which allows users to match transfers to households. This should supply data on the total number of people in households which receive one or more transfers. Alternatively, if the country maintains a national individual identity number system (linked to vital registration of births and deaths), and both transfer programmes record the identification numbers of recipients, it may be possible to merge programme recipient databases to obtain a unified list. If there are two programmes with the potential for overlap (i.e. the potential for double-counting of households which receive transfers from both programmes), but no single registry or other means by which to match recipient lists, staff will need to obtain a population-based (census or household Survey) estimate of overlap. ï§ It is possible but unlikely that this will be available from an existing, generalpurpose national Survey or census (unless the transfer programme has widespread coverage, it is unlikely that the Survey form will include questions about it). If DFID and the Ministry implementing the transfer programme agree, it may be worth lobbying the CSO for inclusion in the Survey form questions asking if households receive transfers. Once again, however, unless the transfer programme is very large, it is unlikely that normal sampling methods designed to yield statistically-valid estimates at a high level (e.g. national, rural and urban) will find enough transfer-recipient households to yield statistically-valid estimates of the characteristics of these households (whether of household size or any other characteristic). If the transfer programme operates only in defined areas, one option may be to argue for - and possibly provide funds for - oversampling and an extra questionnaire module on transfers in these Districts or Provinces. 9 ï§ If (as is likely) existing national Surveys do not collect the necessary information (because the Survey does not ask households about transfers that they receive), the programme will need to conduct a tailored Survey to estimate the degree of overlap. To do this, the list of recipient households for one programme should be used as a sample frame. Programme staff should come up with their best estimate of the percentage of households receiving this transfer which also receive other transfers: this figure gets fed into the choice of sample size that is needed to obtain statistically robust estimates. From the Survey, it will be possible to estimate what percentage of recipients of programme A also receive transfers under programme B. This percentage is multiplied by the total number of transfers under programme A (taken from the MIS) to provide an estimate for the number of households receiving both transfers. This number is then subtracted from the total number of households receiving transfers from programme B (derived from that programmeâs MIS) to obtain an estimate of the number of households that only receive transfers from programme B. See Worked Example 3 above and illustration of this example below.",,,Monthly ,,,"Reliable and timely reporting of coverage Country offices will need to ensure that DFID-supported cash transfer programmes generate reliable coverage figures on a timely basis every year. This will involve agreeing with those running the programme that coverage figures are supplied by the MIS for DFID reporting, within an acceptable time period. Country offices should provide quality assurance by ensuring that schemes include outreach and accountability mechanisms, and conduct periodic spot checks and audits to confirm the reliability of the MIS figures. Where DFID is providing budget support and relying on Government reports for data on the numbers supported by cash transfer schemes, the country office should satisfy itself that the data is realistic and the source robust. Country offices should have data on (i) total coverage for all cash transfer programmes supported by DFID; and (ii) for programmes in which DFID funding is combined with funding from other sources (government or other donors), DFIDâs share of spend (see âData includedâ below).","The methodology for calculating coverage (total individuals in households receiving a transfer) is outlined above under Technical definition / methodological summary. This also describes how to estimate total DFID-supported coverage when DFID is supporting two or more cash transfer programmes with household overlap between the programmes. The section âWhen it is countedâ above describes the periods for which coverage should be reported, at two points in the year (March and September). When DFIDâs financial contribution is a share of programme costs, DFID-supported coverage figures should be calculated as a share of the total coverage that is proportionate to the financial share in total programme costs. Similarly, when DFID  11 is providing budget support, DFID contribution to total coverage should be calculated as a proportion of the governmentâs total annual expenditure (financed from domestic revenue, borrowing and total budget support).",,"Monthly When paper reports had to be passed up through various administrative levels of MIS systems, lags could be long. With reasonable institutional capacity, information and communication technologies (ICTs) (reporting by email or entry onto an online MIS database) and good reporting discipline, it should now be possible to collate figures at the capital within less than a month. Data (e.g. average household size) from national surveys can take considerably longer (at best a few months, quite often nine months).","There are three layers of quality assurance (QA) in place, not including any processes put in place by partners or implementers. 1. Country Offices comment on the quality of the data (see annex A), and provide a link to the calculations spreadsheet, in their return. In addition, Country Offices also assess data quality used during Annual Reviews and Project Completion Reviews and some conduct field visits, evaluations or triangulate data with other sources. Some offices also use third party monitors to conduct verifications in areas which it is not safe for DFID to visit. 2. Regional statisticians check the return, and the calculations, and record any issues in a QA log. 3. FCPD statisticians review the QA log and action any comments logged for FCPD action.

Investing in capacity building and ICT systems (e.g. databases where figures can be entered online and there are checks built in to pick up erroneous values) can significantly improve data completeness and quality. When the programme only generates routine formal reports on a quarterly basis and this doesnât coincide with the timing of DFID reporting needs, it may be necessary for DFID country offices to agree with the programme to provide December coverage figures directly.",,"See URL (chart) Comment for ""frequency of data collection"": Coverage data should be reported for each period in which the grant is given out. Some programmes provide a monthly transfer, and so will report on this basis; some programmes provide fewer, larger payments (e.g. quarterly). The Management Information System (MIS) should generate reports for programme management and accountability: these report outputs may be generated at intervals less frequent than the payment period (e.g. when quarterly reports present data on the last three months of programme coverage).",,,,https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540033/cash-transfers4.pdf,,
No level,,Number of people supported by DFID programmes to cope with the effects of climate change,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Climate Change Adaptation & Disaster Risk Reduction,,"Identifying the target number of beneficiaries is now an essential step in the business planning process, and will be a key output/outcome indicator for any programme DFID supports. Definitions âSupportâ is defined as direct assistance from the programme in question, with the explicit intention of helping people deal with climate change impacts. It could include for example financial resources, assets, agricultural inputs, training, communications (e.g. early warning systems) or information (e.g. weather forecasting). Whilst almost any development intervention that has the outcome of reducing poverty and therefore vulnerability could be described as supporting people to cope with the effects of climate change, the definition here requires the effects of climate change to be explicitly recognised and targeted by the programme in question1. âPeople supportedâ should relate to populations or households2 identified by the programme in question with a direct relationship to it. âEffects of climate changeâ are defined here as the effects of both existing climate variability and the magnified impacts of future climate change. Normally resulting from the primary consequences of climate change of: changes to precipitation, temperature and sea level rise, these may be sudden onset or gradual, and can include floods, droughts, storms, andslides, salination, coastal inundation, heat or cold waves andvbiodiversity loss. Application This indicator relates to the UK International Climate Fund (ICF) impact statement from the theory of change for adaptation to climate change: ""Vulnerable people in poor countries are prepared and equipped to respond effectively to existing climate variability and the magnified impacts of climate changeâ. This indicator seeks to measure the numbers of people who have received an input of support as a proxy for preparing and equipping them, but does not seek to measure the output of whether this support was successful in reducing the impacts of climate change events or effects on these people, or the outcome of increasing their resilience or reducing their vulnerability to climate change. For the ICF we will seek to capture this outcome of improved resilience to climate change through evaluation and other indicators where possible. It is desirable to distinguish between numbers of poor people and numbers of vulnerable people, as not all vulnerable people are poor, and it is not always the poorest that are vulnerable, but this methodology does not encompass this definition yet. Future methodological work is planned to provide a more robust and multi-dimensional definition, and to deepen our understanding of who is vulnerable to climate change. All interventions should be in developing (non-OECD) countries, therefore at least according to this broad categorisation the people supported will be located in poor countries. However this methodology does not define which countries or people are poor or specify that these people have to be targeted by the intervention in question, though if it is possible to disaggregate by level of poverty this should be done (see the labels under the âfurther informationâ section below) . This indicator should only cover bilateral spend at this stage. Multilateral and other support (e.g. direct to NGOs), will be collected and calculated separately, to ensure the same individuals arenât double counted, e.g. if supported in different ways (or even the same way) by geographically overlapping programmes. There are two dimensions of âsupportâ: 1) Targeted: defined as whether people (or households) can be identified by the programme as receiving direct support, can be counted individually and are aware they are receiving support in some form. This implies a high degree of attribution to the programme. 2) Intensity: defined as the level of support/effort provided per person, on a continuum but broad levels may be defined as: a. Low: e.g. people falling within an administrative area of an institution (e.g. Ministry or local authority) receiving capacity building support or people within a catchment area of a river basin subject to a water resources management plan. b. Medium :e.g. people receiving information services such as a flood warning or weather forecast by text, people within catchment area of structural flood defences, people living in a community where other members have been trained in emergency flood response. c. High: e.g. houses raised on plinths, cash transfers, agricultural extension services, training of individuals in communities to develop emergency plans These dimensions are not completely exclusive, medium intensity support may be either targeted (e.g. early warning text messages) or not targeted (catchment area of a flood defence system). However high intensity support should always be targeted, and low intensity support cannot normally be considered targeted. Low intensity support should not be reported for this indicator 3 Categories A single programme may include interventions which are direct and indirect (e.g. a programme which has activities including social protection and early warning systems). A single intervention may also include people supported directly and people supported indirectly, e.g. individuals trained to develop community emergency plans and use early warning There are therefore 2 categories for reporting: A) Direct: Targeted & High intensity. Must fulfil both criteria e.g. people receiving social protection cash transfers, houses raised on plinths, agricultural extension services, training of individuals in communities to develop emergency plans and use early warning systems. B) Indirect: which covers: i) Targeted & Medium intensity: e.g. people receiving weather information and text message early warnings. ii) Not targeted & Medium intensity: e.g. people within the coverage of an early warning system, or catchment area of a large infrastructure project (e.g. flood defences), or living in a discrete community in which others have been trained in emergency response Programmes are only required to distinguish direct and indirect support (and not the sub-categories of âindirectâ above - e.g. whether targeted or not) A third category does not need to be reported at all: C) Not Reported: Indirect and Low intensity: e.g. people benefiting from falling within an administrative area of an institution receiving capacity building support, or catchment area of a Water Resources Management plan or strategy (these numbers can be captured through the programmeâs own monitoring, and for the ICF the interventions under the âinstitutional developmentâ scorecard KPIs). If you are unsure how to break down the number of people your programme supports into these categories please contact the adaptation and water resource management team leads as listed at the end of this document. Gender: Reporting by gender has been marked as mandatory. If you are unable to disaggregate by gender please see the additional guidance in the data disaggregation section below. 4 systems would be supported directly, whereas people living in the same community and benefiting from those plans would be supported indirectly Further information 2 further optional labels can then be applied within the above categories: 1. The first label is simply: Does this programme fit under any of the sectors prioritised in the ICF adaptation thematic paper? That is: (a) access to social protection (if the programme is defined as an âadaptationâ intervention) including micro-finance and broader social protection/insurance mechanisms; (b) support to water shed and water basin management (both the construction of small-scale infrastructure at household or community level and large-scale support for watershed and water basin management activities; (c) support with urban resilience including resilient infrastructure; (d) support to any community and/or national level disaster risk reduction activities; (e) support for resilient agriculture programmes; (f) support for eco-systems development and coastal zone management programmes; and (g) support for health programmes which are primarily tackling climate change risks. 2. The second label considers the proportion that are poor: What proportion of the beneficiaries are poor? Numbers of poor people could be determined by numbers below a country specific poverty line rather than the international $1.25/day definition. For programmes which have indirect beneficiaries, proportions of poor could be estimated from social vulnerability analyses commissioned as part of the programme preparation or any prior Climate Change Strategic Programme Reviews. Methodological points to note: 1. Numbers of people supported through multilateral multi-sector adaptation programmes where UK is major funder will also be included in this indicator. We will be working with the multilateral partners to ensure this headline indicator can be gathered in future. 2. With multi-sectoral support there is scope for double-counting of results, we will therefore ensure that targeted interventions are tagged against one or another sector. 3. Finally, both household and individual data can be collected as part of this exercise. Data on household size should be determined from the most recent national census data or from a nationally representative household survey. If data is collected at the household level, the country office will need to multiply the number of households by the average household size.","This is a new area of programming. Although we are not envisaging all programmes to be able to gather all of the disaggregated levels of data, what is collected will strengthen the story on our adaptation portfolio and strengthen our evidence base. This indicator links clearly to policy priorities around climate adaptation as articulated by the International Climate Fund Board. With limited international consensus on measuring successful adaptation, HMGâs development of these and other indicators will be leading the way in the international community.","Absolute numbers of beneficiaries only, disaggregated by direct/indirect and gender.

These figures however do not give an indication of whether this support was successful in reducing the impacts of climate change events or effects on these people, or the outcome of increasing their resilience or reducing their vulnerability to climate change.","By nature of the indicator the baseline for the programme in question will normally be zero for number of people supported by DFID. The possible exception being where the programme is an extension of an existing DFID programme that preceded the current Comprehensive Spending Review, in which case a baseline of 2011/12 should be used. [For the aggregated total for DFID overall the baseline will be zero at the start of the Comprehensive Spending Review period].",,,"The indicator will be measured through the monitoring and, to some extent, evaluation of DFID bilateral climate adaptation programmes and multilateral programmes, particularly those financed by the UKâs International Climate Fund (ICF). In some cases (e.g. on-going programmes in Bangladesh) the data will be generated through project-specific Surveys. Where DFID programmes are operated through government (e.g. the Ethiopia PSNP), the data will come from separate commissions. Similarly, data on proportions of poor will be undertaken through individual Surveys at project level and then attributed to the programme. Perhaps at a later stage, household level Surveys will begin to gather this data more readily. The aggregation for this indicator will be undertaken by Climate and Environment Department (CED) across all projects/programmes.",,,Annual ,,,DFID Country Offices select the most relevant data and calculations and submit these to CED.,"The indicator is expressed in absolute numbers, so not relevant. However, the data will be aggregated by CED using the numbers provided against sector interventions summed across to arrive at a total figure. It is possible that some of the disaggregated levels of data are provided as percentages. These will then be converted as appropriate into absolute numbers. Where HMG are only funding part of the project, benefits (number of people) should be calculated as a pro-rata share of funding. For example, if we are funding 10% of a project with 100 beneficiaries, we should claim that 10 of these beneficiaries are attributable to DFID. It is possible for a single programme to reach both direct (targeted and high intensity) and indirect (targeted or not targeted and medium intensity) beneficiaries in which case these should be reported separately.","This output level indicator is relevant to measuring DFIDâs public commitment to help millions of people to protect their lives and livelihoods from the effects of climate change. This indicator measures how many people are benefitting and who those people are. A majority of the results achieved for this indicator are through one global programme. The implementers of this programme work with around 300 different projects, each of which is required to return results against this indicator based on information gathered as part of their routine project monitoring. The quality of inputs from across these projects is not fully understood. The largest of the other country office programmes which contribute to the results achieved also measure results through routine project monitoring. We have been told by programme managers that results are reasonably accurate. This indicator by itself gives very little information as to the quality or nature of the support given; this can be obtained from complementary project information. The nature of the support provided can and does vary widely, for example from raising a house on a plinth to providing training to react to an early warning system alarm. There are no concerns in regards to cost and confidentiality.","This will have to be worked through with country offices and multilateral partners, but a 6-9 month lag may be necessary.","It is recommended that, where possible, data collection and quality assurance is undertaken by a third party that is not directly involved with implementing the project. Country offices will need to estimate country- level aggregation, where separate programmes may support the same people in different ways. Country offices will be in the best position to do this analysis on geographic overlap. If reporting officers have any concerns about the quality of data, then 7 please note this in the DRF results template.",,,"Comment for ""frequency of data collection"": It should be possible for country offices (and eventually multilateral partners) to report on beneficiary numbers at least annually (to inform Annual Reviews). CED will collate this information annually. Robust data from programmes already in implementation may be difficult to gather as baselines are unlikely to have been developed in all cases. Therefore we expect the routine M&E of these programmes to be able to generate this information.",,,,https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540036/Climate-change23.pdf,"CED also plans to undertake more methodological work on definitions of vulnerability and will aim to do an evaluation on the impact of the ICF programmes on resilience. At some future date, these indicators can be used in conjunction with the indicator above to strengthen its impact focus. The number of people supported to cope with climate change indicator is new and attempts to measure a new area in development of common international interest. We have shared this methodology with a number of international partners including the MDBs and other donors and a number of these partners have chosen to replicate this methodology in their own reporting.",
No level,,Number of children completing primary education supported by DFID (per annum),DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Education,,"Overview: Estimates the total number of children completing primary school, funded by DFID, broken down by sex. The estimate uses the new entrants to the last grade of primary education as a proxy for those completing primary school. This does not include an assessment of the quality of education or attendance at school, and does not include all of DFIDâs support to education. Targeted project interventions (eg on improving learning, or early grades) which do not comprehensively cover a childâs primary education are excluded Definition: The methodology takes a pro-rata share of gross intake in to the last grade of primary school, where the share is calculated as DFIDâs contribution to the education budget for the relevant schools or pupils. Gross intake is defined as the gross enrolment in the last grade of primary education (regardless of pupil age), minus repeaters. This is used as a proxy for those completing primary school. First the percentage of total education spend on a set of primary schools or pupils covered by DFID is estimated. This is usually the DFID total spend on the relevant primary schools or pupils divided by the total (Government and donor) spend on the relevant primary schools or pupils. Secondly, this percentage of spend covered by DFID is multiplied by the gross intake in to the last grade of primary. For general and sector budget support, and most education financial aid projects, this would be the total DFID spend on [primary] education divided by the total Government and donor spend on [primary] education, multiplied by the total gross intake into the last Grade in publically funded schools. In most cases, when it is not possible to apportion between the different levels of education, DFID and Government/donor total spend on education (or basic education, when this is the focus of DFID support) would be used. In this case, the same expenditure share figure would be used in the calculation for the numbers completing primary education and the numbers supported in lower secondary school. In some cases the pro-rata share of enrolment is not possible or meaningful to calculate (eg because the total education budget is unknown for a subset of schools, or a DFID project is not aimed at fully funding a childâs education). In this case, pupils can be counted if we have evidence that the child would not have been in school or not learning at all throughout primary school without DFIDâs support. In this case the children supported would be calculated from project specific evaluations or data sets (eg using the number of additional enrolments in the last Grade as a result of the DFID programme). With jointly funded programmes, a pro-rata share of these additional enrolments should be calculated using DFIDâs share of the programme funding.",Estimates the number of children supported by DFID to complete primary school in any one academic year. This enables DFID to attribute what its education aid investment buys in terms of primary completion. Increasing DFID financial support or increasing completion of primary education could both result in an increased number supported. Intake to the last grade of primary is accepted as a proxy for primary completers in at least one internationally recognised definition for completion rates.,"Number of children supported by DFID in lower secondary education per year, disaggregated by sex, along with a record of workings. In addition, the following should be clearly highlighted: any deviations from the standard methodology described in this note; any specific concerns about the quality of the data; any major risks to achievement; and an explanation for any major changes from results or forecasts provided previously. Type of indicator: Cumulative ",,Sex,"The number of children supported by DFIDâs can fluctuate for a number of reasons. This could be a sign of improved performance due to: -  An increase in completion, or -  A decrease in unit costs It could also indicate increases in DFID expenditure in education or general budget support. But it could also be due to other factors, which may not be related to improved performance. For example, a decrease in Government spending on education could increase the number of children supported by DFID without a real increase in performance or enrolment. Similarly, decreases in the number supported by DFID could also be a sign of decreases in enrolment or increases in unit costs, or just reflect decreases in DFID spending on education or budget support, or increases in Government spending. In some cases variations could reflect changes in the methodology of the EMIS or expenditure data. Hence fluctuations in the number should be interpreted carefully. This indicator focuses on funding and enrolments. Hence it does not give an indication of the quality of the education, or of whether and how much a child is actually attending school. This is because of the problems of internationally comparable data in these areas. DFID is looking into additional indicators for the future which could cover these important areas. The indicator excludes consideration of household expenditure on education, as it is not currently possible to include this in a meaningful and consistent way. This would lead to the indicator overestimating DFIDâs contribution. The indicator also excludes DFIDâs influence over and above its financial contribution (eg on policy and national programmes), which is likely to be substantial in many countries. This would lead to the indicator underestimating DFIDâs contribution. The use of gross intake rate assumes the numbers starting the final grade, minus repeaters, will be the same as the number completing the final grade. In reality it could be an overestimate due to additional numbers dropping out during the year. The estimates for primary school completion cannot be directly compared to the total numbers supported in primary school. Some countries will have projects that are included in the numbers supported in primary school, but not in the estimate for the numbers completing primary school (when the project only supports early grades, for example).","The baseline varies for each country depending on when data was available. In most cases it is 2009/10, but in some cases later years are used. For each country, the total number of children supported to date is the sum of the children supported each year since the baseline (usually 2010/11 to the latest available year). DFID wide performance is the total of the individual country results.",,,"DFID spend data can be found in ARIES. This should include general budget support, education sector budget support, education projects and financial aid, and general projects and financial aid that include support to education. Non ear-marked support to multi-lateral organisations is excluded. Partner country expenditure data can be sourced from Government systems (Ministry of Education or Ministry of Finance). For some countries World Development Indicators may have data not available elsewhere. Data for the gross intake into the last Grade of primary school should be taken directly from country Education Management Information Systems (EMISs), or from project specific enrolment data. Where EMIS data includes enrolment in non-government (and DFID) funded schools, care must be taken to adjust total enrolment accordingly. Care should also be taken to use INTAKE (ie enrolment minus repeaters) rather than just enrolment when possible, as this is a better proxy for completion and avoids double counting across years. For projects, total and additional enrolments and expenditure data should be available from project monitoring reports. However care should be taken to adjust according to the DFID share of the project or programme. Any project can be included where they are providing some support to children in schools, but only where there is concrete robust evidence that there is a real increase in completion rates. Government expenditure and enrolment data is also available from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS), but it takes up to two years for national data to be collected and processed by UIS. In addition the data are then presented according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) which may not align to national definitions.

No level,,Number of people supported to have choice and control over their own development and to hold decision-makers to account,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Human rights,,"Overview: This indicator is a headcount measure of the reach of DFID-supported empowerment and accountability, in terms of the number of unique beneficiaries. It is not a measure of whether beneficiaries have been empowered since empowerment is a complex and broad concept. Definiton: How to count: methods for including programme results into the indicator The numbers reported should be attributable to DFID1 . See the general guidance note and example below for how to attribute results. The key concept being measured is the number of unique beneficiaries of DFID programmes in this area over the Spending Review period. The nature of the programme itself will determine how to get at the number of unique beneficiaries, as the following scenarios illustrate. This is a measure of the number of unique beneficiaries of DFID empowerment and accountability programmes. It is not a measure of whether the individuals are empowered, since this is a complex concept. The different designs of DFID programmes mean that various calculation methods will have to be used to capture to the key concept of unique beneficiaries. More detail is provided in the Data Calculation Section below. How to deal with overlapping programmes It is likely that country offices will contribute to this indicator through several different programs. Countries should provide in the comments section the disaggregated information showing the number of people supported through each project/program as well as the overall contribution to this indicator. e.g. -  Beneficiaries of program A -  Beneficiaries of program B -  Total number of individual beneficiaries = C Note that C does not necessarily = A + B, if some individuals are beneficiaries of both programmes. If this is the case, you will need to estimate the overlap in the way that is most appropriate to your country context and based on your professional expertise. More detail is provided in the Data Calculation Section below. There is space in the template to record your assumptions The overlap between country programmes and BBC Media Action The Policy Division in the central part of DFID fund a programme through BBC Media which support people in a number of countries by enhancing the availability of information. Some of these countries may also benefit from programmes funded by the DFID country office. It is important to eliminate the risk of double counting, and this handled centrally after the data have been collected. We subtract from the BBC Media Actio contribution the contribution of the local DFID office in each country that benefits from BBC Media Action and DFID country programmes. What to count: definition of âsupported to have choice and controlâ Programmes which may contribute to the indicator are: -  Support to Parliament (e.g. number of additional people visiting their MP) -  Support to councils/traditional leaders (e.g. no. of additional people meeting with their local councillor or traditional leader) -  Participatory surveys (e.g. number of people engaging in the survey) -  Strengthen community monitoring capacity (e.g. number of people who participate in government or community monitoring) -  Community planning (e.g. number of individuals engaged in community planning) -  Budget analysis and tracking (e.g. number of individuals using budget analysis for advocacy) -  Programmes which enhance the availability of information which can empower individuals and enable them to have more choice and to hold decision makers to account (e.g. information about the decisions taken by government representatives, or about mechanisms that citizens can use to hold government to account). (Beneficiaries should be those expected to access the new information). Programmes to exclude: -  Cash transfers -  Programmes with headcount beneficiaries under another Operational Plan (OP) indicator (unless such beneficiaries also benefit from a separate programme on E&A then you can count them) o Example 1. If you have a programme to enhance school management committees, then the members of these committees, or people informed by the committees, would count as beneficiaries. However children, who gain access to school as a result of the committees, would not count. o Example 2: If a programme supports health committees then beneficiaries include those participating in the committees and those informed by the committees through media etc. Those informed, who go on to use health services, should not be counted (again).o Example 3: If a programme supports elections in some way, and the people supported to should be included under the elections indicator and not double counted here. E&A beneficiaries of broader sectoral programmes may be included against this indicator but it is important that only the beneficiaries supported on E&A areincluded. Staff should not include the broader set of beneficiaries in the sectoral  programme. An example could be that 3 million people receive improved health services and that (of those 3 million), 50,000 people provide feedback on those services through citizenâs score cards. The count against this indicator should be 50,000",Mechanisms for people to have more information and to hold decision makers to account are an important part of the broader theory of change that leads to more effective and responsive institutions. This indicator has been chosen because it gives a broad sense of the scale of DFID programming in this important area.,"Number of people supported to have choice and control over their own development and to hold decision-makers to account per year, disaggregated by sex if possible, along with a record of workings. In addition, the following should be clearly highlighted: any deviations from the standard methodology described in this note; any specific concerns about the quality of the data; any major risks to achievement of the forecast; and an explanation for any major changes from results or forecasts provided previously Type of indicator: Peak year or cumulative depending on the intervention and measurement at country level",,"Sex (if possible) Note: To enable corporate reporting on the different Types of initiatives disaggregate by programme Type and have a clear description of the programme the related indicator and the tool (e.g. questionnaire, interviews, media) used to generate the data",An increased number of people supported at output level would be considered positive progress. A result in excess of the public commitment of 40 million is considered a success.,Measured for the first time in 2011-12. There may be a baseline for a specific country based on the method chosen.,,,"There are different possible sources as follows. In the cases where multiple sources maybe available DFID programme data is the preferred source as it most easily attributed to DFID.: -  DFID programme data Much data are likely to be available directly through the program. For example in Zambia the programme directly counts the numbers of extra people meeting with their MP. -  Survey data In some cases the result of a programme may be measured through Survey data (for example in Ethiopia). -  Population data In some cases, an intervention may affect the full population or full adult population in a particular geographical area. In these cases, population data should be taken from the most reliable source (population wide sources include (a) the last population census (b) interim census population projection estimates, usually conducted by the national statistics office (c) electoral roll data)",,,Annual ,,,DFID Country Offices select the most relevant data and calculations and submit these to the DFID HQ. The final numbers and calculations are then quality assured by the DFID HQ,"How to count: methods for including programme results into the indicator If a programme is solely funded by DFID, DFID should count all recipients of the programme.If the programme is joint funded (or DFID is supporting a government programme) the number of recipients is calculated as: Number of recipients/beneficiaries attributable to DFID = Total number of recipients/beneficiaries x (DFID expenditure / Total budget ) In the scenario where the programme provides on-going support or mentoring over a number of years, âpeak yearâ figures will be used (rather than cumulative). If the figure for the baseline year consists of DFID beneficiaries then this need not be subtracted; otherwise the baseline figure will be subtracted. For example, if DFID is supporting 10 million people though the coverage of citizen's scorecards for 4 years, and that these are essentially the same people we should count 10 million people, not 40 million. You should be clear about this in your presentation so that it is not interpreted as 2.5 million a year for four years. If a programme provides a one off intervention, such as the opportunity for constituents to meet their elected representative, then there are different beneficiaries in each year of the programme. The figures for each year will therefore be accumulated. For example, if DFID is supporting 5,000 extra individuals to meet their elected representatives in each of 4 years, it is reasonable to claim 4 x 5,000 = 20,000 unique beneficiaries. How to deal with overlapping programmes It is likely that country offices will contribute to this indicator through several different programs. If this is the case, you will need to estimate the overlap in the way that is most appropriate to your country context and based on your professional expertise. Possible approaches that you might consider are: -  Taking account of geographic coverage: if programmes are in different regions it may be appropriate to assume zero overlap. -  Reporting the single biggest programme as your contribution, where these are likely to overlap heavily, or where it is difficult to assess the overlap. -  Taking a probabilistic approach. In your situation is it reasonable to assume that benefiting from Programme 1 doesnot affect your chance of benefit fromProgramme 2? In that case you can calculate the chance that the same individual benefits from both just by luck. For example, in a community of 100,000 there are 5,000 who benefit from Prog1 and 20,000 from Prog2. Being in one programme does not affect your chance of benefiting from the other. In this case everyone in Prog2 has a (5/100) chance of already being in Prog1 - in other words 0.05 * 20,000 = 1,000 will not be ânewâ unique beneficiaries. So the  contribution to the indicator would be 5,000 + 19,000 = 24,000. It doesnât matter which order you do the calculation. (20/100) of Prog1 participants will already be part of Prog2, so there are 0.2 * 5,000 = 1,000 who are not ânewâ, just as above ",This output level indicator is relevant measuring DFIDâs public commitment to support 40 million people to hold authorities to account. It gives a broad indication of the reach of DFID empowerment and accountability interventions. The majority (60%) of the results are achieved through one global programme where results are measured through representative sample surveys and expected to be reasonably accurate and timely. The largest country office programmes measures results through Management Information Systems for which the accuracy is less well understood.

It thus makes it easier to identify priorities, design more effective programmes, and facilitate the coordination of response efforts. The IPC draws on a number of conceptual frameworks and approaches for food security analysis (including the four pillars of access, availability, (nutritional) utilization and stability) and livelihoods analysis. Using the analysis templates ensures that classifications are based on analysis that is transparent, rigorous, and, to the greatest extent possible, evidence based. It also allows for sub national, regional and international comparisons, thus helping to direct funding where assistance is needed most. The IPC explicitly draws, but not exclusively, from nutrition indicators. This is critical from both a practical perspective (nutrition data is not always available and needs to be triangulated with other food security data), and a conceptual perspective (it is well accepted that nutrition is a late outcome indicator of food insecurity). While the IPC uses nutrition data, it also draws from indicators that provide triangulation and give earlier indications that crisis is imminent.

No level,,Number of hectares where deforestation and degradation have been avoided through DFID support,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Natural Resource Management,,"This indicator will aggregate: a. the number of hectares where deforestation has been avoided; b. the number of hectares where forest degradation has been avoided; c. the number of hectares where afforestation has taken place; and d. the number of hectares where reforestation has taken place. The indicator will be measured though the annual monitoring and evaluation of bilateral forestry programmes and multilateral programmes funded by the UK under the International Climate Fund (ICF). The following document, saved on QUEST, has been constructed to help with this exercise: Data collection tool for hectares indicator. Deforestation, degradation, afforestation and reforestation of land are defined according to changes in forest type or land use, as categorised by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). These changes can be recorded by programme managers using the accompanying Excel template. The categorisations of forest types, land uses and degradation levels can be found at: http://www.fao.org/tc/exact/user-guides/en/ Programme managers should proceed in three stages: Step 1: Establish the counterfactual: what is the expected land use in the absence of the intervention? Step 2: Estimate the impact of the intervention: what is the expected land use after the intervention? Step 3: Calculate the difference between counterfactual and intervention. Because of the risks of leakage1 and non-permanence2 , programme managers should in the first instance identify: (i) the geographical scope of programme (size of programme area) and (ii) the time-frame over which they expect the programme to have an impact. Step 1: Establishing the Counterfactual This step involves establishing the expected land use in the absence of the intervention. The first stage is to establish the current size and type of forested areaa ffected by the intervention. Key data sources here are the national and sub-national data on forest coverage in the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)âs Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA)3 . An alternative would be to conduct a baseline specifically for the intervention. Forest type should be categorised according to the categories in the excel sheet. The programme manager should then estimate the expected changes in land use that would result in the absence of the programme, accounting for other deforestation pressures such as population growth, international timber prices, prices of substitutes, etc.  -  Deforestation: the number of hectares (within project area) where wood will be harvested in absence of intervention (in the reporting year)  -  Degradation: the number of hectares (within project area) where forest land will be degraded without the intervention (in reporting year)  -  Afforestation: the number of hectares (within project area) where forests will be planted, on previously unforested land, without the intervention (in reporting year)  -  Reforestation: the number of hectares (within project area) where forests will be replanted, on previously forested land, without the intervention (in reporting year) The counterfactual involves identifying the most likely economic activity on the land in the absence of an intervention. For example the programme manager may want to consider:  -  For natural forest land, is there pressure from agricultural expansion to convert it to cropland?  -  For degraded land, is there pressure from palm oil expansion to convert it into a palm oil plantation?  -  For deforested land, are there plans to reforest it or construct buildings to settle permanently? In the absence of local information, national rates of deforestation can be used to estimate the counterfactual land use. However, it is important to adapt these national rates if rates of land-use change are occurring at different speeds throughout the country. For example, some regions are experiencing fast deforestation due to easy access while others are still remote and therefore intact, e.g. inner versus outer Amazon regions. Step 2: Estimating the impact of the intervention  This step is about the change in land use after the intervention. -  Deforestation: the number of hectares (within project area) where wood was harvested (in the reporting year))  -  Degradation: the number of hectares (within project area) where forest land was degraded (in reporting year)  -  Afforestation: the number of hectares (within project area) whereforests were planted (in reporting year)  -  Reforestation: the number of hectares (within project area) where forests were replanted (in reporting year) Step 3: Difference between counterfactual and actual To calculate the total number of hectares figure, the programme managers should do the following calculation: (Expected ha deforested under counterfactual) - (Actual ha deforested) + (Expected ha degraded under counterfactual) - (Actual ha degraded) + (Actual ha afforested) - (Expected ha afforested under counterfactual) + (Actual ha reforested) - (Expected ha reforested under counterfactual) Key programmes which are expected to report against this indicator (and in turn be aggregated in order to calculate the headline âtotal hectaresâ figure) include:  -  Forestry and Climate Change (DFID Climate and Environment Department, CED)  -  Forests, Governance, Markets and Climate (DFID CED) -  Nepal Multi-Stakeholder Forestry Programme (DFID Nepal)  -  Reducing Deforestation in the Brazilian Cerrado (DEFRA)  -  South Asia Alliance for Climate Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods (DFID Asia Regional Office)  -  Forests Investment Programme (multilateral programme managed by the World Bank)  -  Papua Comprehensive Programme on Spatial Planning and Low Carbon Development (DFID Indonesia) These programmes have been selected on the basis that they have already included some form of ânumber of hectaresâ target in their Business Case or Strategic Case. Additional contributions to this result/indicator from other programmes not listed here, or developed in the future, will subsequently be added to the list. A simplified version of the reporting format from the UN FAO Carbon Balance tool (FAO EX ACT4 ) will be used as a template for programme  data collection5 . This reporting format will also collect the data needed to calculate greenhouse gas emissions and the value of ecosystem services (reported under separate indicators). Programme managers will identify the most appropriate source of data, as there may be reliable data provided by national bodies or other international bodies. In some cases where interventions are location specific (in particular under Forests and Climate Change), the data will be collected from project level surveys. In other cases (for example, the Brazilian Cerrado programme and the South Asia Alliance for Climate Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods) data from national forestry inventories will be used alongside programme survey data. DFIDâs corporate results framework only relates to DFID spend, not the wider ICF. Where a project or programme is co-funded with other departments, the number of hectares avoided will be attributed to DFID on a pro-rata basis according to contribution to specific programmes. However, as this indicator will also be used for ICF reporting, where it is possible to measure results from DECC and/or DEFRA reporting this should also be noted, so as to avoid a repeat exercise to generate the required data for the ICF Board. Some programmes will be able to report against multiple ICF indicators. For example, the Forest Investment Programme will also be expected to report on the indicator: âmillions of tons of CO2 emissions reduced as a result of reduced deforestation and degradationâ. The CO2 figure is based on a hectares calculation, which will be used to inform this indicator. For multilateral programmes (e.g. the Forests Investment Programme) it will also be necessary to adjust the total number of hectares saved on a pro-rata basis and account for the ICFâs contribution to the programme. It will be important to be clear about the funding channel through which results are secured, as results generated through multilateral funding may need to be reported slightly differently (e.g. using the multilateral fundâs indicators and methodologies where these are compatible with, but not necessarily identical to, DFIDâs indicator). Methodological points to note: 1. This indicator does not measure changes in the international rate of deforestation and degradation as measured every five years by the FAO. UK spending is not thought to be sufficiently large that changes in international rates could be directly attributed to UK programmes. The ânumber of hectares where deforestation and degradation has been avoidedâ is designed to express UK contribution towards decreasing international trends . 2. A hectare of avoided deforestation, of afforestation, or of avoided   degradation is treated with equal weight in the indicator calculation. Therefore this indicator measures the absolute number of hectares of land in which our programmes have been engaged. The impact of changes in forest quality will be measured within the greenhouse gas emissions and value of ecosystems indicators. 3. This indicator is reporting a gross figure. It does not directly measureleakage (for example, shutting down illegal logging in one region or country could simply displace companies to another area with weaker governance structures in place). More work will be done to ensure that programmes measure leakage through complementary programme level indicators as part of programme monitoring and evaluation. 4. Expected results (the target number of hectares that will be saved) willbe calculated as the sum of the expected results from each of the contributing programmes. These should be in line with the economic assessment section of the programme Business Case. It may not be possible to estimate the target hectares saved for the whole ICF until all Business Cases have been completed and all programmes have established a baseline. 5. To date there is no standard methodology for modelling future rates of deforestation/degradation, and there are serious data limitations in many developing countries. Subsequently, a consistent methodology is being refined by CED and programmes will contribute to this processduring the next Results Commission starting in February. Generally, programmes are expected to follow the methodology outlined above, but if this is not suited to their individual circumstances, they will devise an alternative methodology that CED will quality assure andstandardise to contribute to the indicator. 6. Once the methodology has been refined and tested, CED will provide a worked example for successful reporting against this indicator.","The aims of the UKâs forest finance are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the forest sector, preserve bio-diversity and reduce poverty by reducing deforestation and forest degradation. This indicator will provide a broad measure of success against the headline forestry outcome of reduced deforestation and degradation of the worldâs forest land. Programme data will be used as opposed to international forestry data (available from the UN FAO) for the following reasons: -  FAO data is only reported once every five years (though in the future this will be every three years) which is not thought to be sufficiently frequent for DFID reporting purposes; -  As discussed in âtechnical definition/methodologyâ section above, UK 6 spending is not thought to be sufficiently large that changes in international rates could be reasonably attributed to UK programmes. It is reasonable to expect that international rates of deforestation could go up as well as down (for example, due to natural disasters or increases in productive industries using forest land). However, CED and cross-Whitehall colleagues plan to monitor international forestry trends reported by the FAO in order to triangulate project monitoring and evaluation data. Defra is also looking at ways in which satellite data could be used to measure changes in land use.",Number.,,A total ICF figure will be reported but it will also be possible to report the number of hectares where deforestation and degradation has been avoided by country.,"This indicator should report a decrease in the total hectares of forest land deforested and/or degraded, while increasing the total hectares reforested or afforested. This indicator will report these two values combined so a positive value shows the number of hectares where deforestation and degradation have been avoided through DFID support.","As part of programme monitoring and evaluation frameworks, programme officers will be required to submit: (i) a baseline level of deforestation, afforestation or forest degradation in the programme area or country where relevant; and (ii) an estimate of the âbusiness as usualâ (or counterfactual) scenario that would occur if the programme did not take place. The counterfactual involves identifying the most likely outcome and economic activity on the land in the absence of an intervention. This information should be consistent with the economic options appraisal in the Business Case for the relevant programmes.",,,"Programme annual monitoring and evaluation data. For example, for the above identified programmes: -  Forestry and Climate Change: To be finalised as part of the programme Business Case but likely to be based on estimates of avoided deforestation and degradation in the specific (localised) interventions made by the delivery body. Deforestation and degradation gains made through private finance leverage should be calculated pro-rata (for example, if 100 hectares saved, and private funders put in 75% of the finance, then HMG can claim to have saved 25 hectares). -  Nepal Multi-Stakeholder Forestry Programme; Reducing Deforestation in the Brazilian Cerrado; South Asia Alliance for Climate Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods: Changes in the amount of forest land (FAO definition and methodology) based on country forestry inventories where possible, and Survey data collected from programme areas. Data can also be triangulated in some countries using information from the World Resources Institute. -  Forests, Governance, Markets and Climate: More work to be done to finalise methodology but data likely to be drawn from country forestry inventories, timber trade, forestry revenues and information on trends in illegal logging. -  Forests Investment Programme (multilateral): Calculated by the World Bank as part of programme reporting, based on national forestry inventories. Programme annual monitoring and evaluation data from relevant programmes, including those identified above. Some of these programmes (notably Forests and Climate Change) are still under development. Assuming that all pipeline programmes are approved, the seven programmes identified above will have a total forestry spend of 7 Â£377 million over the ICF period (2011/12 - 2014/15). This represents 65% of the total programmed and pipeline ICF forestry spending6 . The seven programmes that have been identified to feed into this indicator all directly tackle the drivers of deforestation and degradation in specific countries. Other forestry programmes that build national institutional capacity or develop knowledge and tools for forestry have not been included here because it is difficult to measure their impact on the number of hectares saved from deforestation and degradation.",,,Annual ,,,DFID Country Offices select the most relevant data and calculations and submit these to DFID.,Aggregation of the total number of hectares of forest land where deforestation and degradation have been avoided in the seven selected programmes (and any other relevant ICF programmes developed).,"This output indicator is relevant to measuring DFIDâs public commitment to give more protection to the worldâs forests and the 1.2 billion people who depend on them. It aims to provide an easily understood high level figure relating to the number of hectares of forest where deforestation and degradation have been avoided. The indicator has proven difficult to apply in practice with only one programme in Nepal able to report progress so far - data quality for this programme is accurate. Many of DFIDâs forestryâs programmes are not designed to plant trees or protect specific areas of forest from deforestation and degradation. Instead, the majority work on a range of governance and capacity building issues, many at international level. It is therefore particularly challenging to infer a direct causal link between our collaborative efforts in policy, legal reform, forest governance and knowledge across many regions, and avoided deforestation or degradation. An evaluation of the methodology for this indicator is being carried out by the University of Edinburgh, which includes the provision of advice and guidance on alternative methodologies that will enable programmes to report against this indicator in a cost effective way. The development of this indicator will be progressed further through the soon to be launched Results, Evidence and Knowledge of the International Climate Fund Programme. There is currently no international consensus on a suitable methodology to measure the number of hectares where deforestation and degradation have been avoided through interventions.","Programme managers should report the number of hectares where deforestation and degradation were avoided in the preceding year. Results will be compared to international changes in the area of forest land in intervention countries, as reported by the UN FAO on a five yearly basis","We anticipate three layers of QA: country offices, CED and FCPD. Within country offices there may need to be consultation with other donors working in the forestry sector.",,Please see the section on data sources above for more information on the different approaches taken by different programmes.,"See Technical Definition Summary Comment for frequency of data collection: Annual monitoring and evaluation reporting from relevant programmes (at a minimum the six identified above). More work needs to be undertaken at a programme level in order to identify the specific methodologies that will be used to calculate the baseline and counterfactual scenario in each intervention country. In particular CED will work to develop the reporting methodology under the Forests and Climate Change programme as part of the Business Case process. This programme at Â£290 million (Â£261 million is forestry spend) comprises 45percentage of the programmed and pipeline forestry spend under the ICF. Additional thought will be given to the methodology behind the hectares indicator for the Forests, Governance, Markets and Climate programme as this programme will have global rather than location specific impacts. Some countries have better land use monitoring systems and forestry inventories in place than others (for example, Brazil is likely to be fairly sophisticated whereas the Democratic Republic of Congo will have relatively basic systems). All countries report to the FAO Global Forests Resources Assessment7 in a standardised format. Data on the number of hectares classed as âforest landâ (FAO definition) should therefore be obtainable from national government sources. Again, data quality will vary from country to country",,,,https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540044/Forestry-hectares-saved25.pdf,"CED will undertake more work to identify a basket of indicators under each programme that will address some of the limitations of this headline indicator. In particular, programmes should seek to identify: -  Changes in the quality of forest land, as reflected by biodiversity, ecosystem services and CO2 sequestration levels. -  Measures of leakage - i.e. where deforestation and degradation have been avoided in intervention areas, has deforestation and degradation increased elsewhere? -  Measures of permanence - will the reported results be undermined by an increase in deforestation at a later point in time? CED is also monitoring international trends in deforestation rates, which are reported every five years by the UN FAO Forests Resources Assessment. In the future, we would like to improve this indicator by: -  Using satellite data to accurately measure changes in forest land and quality of forest land in intervention countries. Satellite data will also help us identify leakage. -  Working with international experts such as the FAO, World Bank Forests Investment Programme staff, World Resources Institute, and the Government of Norway to develop more sophisticated methodologies and improved national forestry inventories",
No level,,Number of countries supported by DFID in freer & fairer elections,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Governance,,"If the following two conditions are both met then country offices should report on this indicator. The first condition is that DFID supports an election in some form (e.g. supporting the updating of a voters registers, police training, observer training, funding observers, support to the election commission). There is no minimum level of spending required to meet the first condition since this does not necessarily relate to the impact of the intervention. . The support will most commonly be delivered as part of a DFID Country Office programme. However, where DFID has provided funds to another party specifically for a programme or programme element designed to support a freer and fairer election (according to the activities above) then those results should also be recorded (and the details of the arrangement reported). Where support is not delivered through a Country Office these results will not be reported in the main statistical tables but elsewhere in the DFID Annual Report. Country offices are required to document the nature of their support. See âCountry office roleâ for more detail. There are two ways to meet the second condition, which relates to DFIDâs commitment to âfreer and fairerâ. The second condition is met if the election is assessed by credible (national or international) observer missions as: -  Credible, -  Non-violent and -  Reflecting the will of the people Alternatively, the second condition would also be met if credible observer missions specifically reported that the election was higher quality than the previous election of the same type (in terms of credibility, nonviolence and reflecting the will of the people).1 For operational purposes Country Offices are asked to report all DFIDsupported elections together with (links to) their recommendations and evidence on whether the second criterion is met.

Aggregation of all voters across all constituencies (or councils etc.). For non-trivial cases - with more than one election day over the SR period - the concept is unique visits to the polling booth. Complexity arises where there is more than one election event over the SR period. The specific concept we are counting is unique electoral events and unique visits to the polling booth. So, for example, the election turn-out for a 2012 election can be added to the turn-out a 2014 election, since these would be unique events. However if local and national elections are staged on the same date, such that citizens can vote in both with a single visit to the polling booth then turn-out for the local and national elections would not be added. Rather, the number of unique people visiting the polling station on the day would be reported. Note that in some cases an electoral event (such as a Presidential Election) may have multiple rounds or run-offs. In this case we report a single electoral event (the one with most voters) and do not count separately each round (even when they held on different days).","These indicators are considered to be of relevance for measuring our public commitment to support freer and fairer elections in 13 countries.

No level,,Number of people reached with emergency food assistance through DFID support,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Emergency Response,,"Only food assistance funded out of DFIDâs humanitarian budgets will be included - regular development budget funded food security programmes will not be included. Reaching more people in a world of growing needs is certainly the objective for now. However, over time, with increased resilience programming in country offices (funded out of development budgets) as well as more sustainable solutions, one would hope that the need for humanitarian food assistance will go down. As data at proposal stage on numbers of beneficiaries are unreliable (especially in sudden onset disasters), we will use ex-post data from monthly results reports, mid-year reviews and project completion reports. To avoid double-counting, we will need to ask partners for information on how many people were reached with food assistance for how long. There are four options: one month, two months, three months or six months. We will not record food assistance programmes of less than one month. In exceptional circumstances, humanitarian programmes could also provide food assistance for longer than six months. Supplementary feeding programmes funded out of humanitarian budget lines should be included in this indicator as they will not be captured by the DFID nutrition indicator (which excludes humanitarian). Cash transfer programmes with the purpose of improving food security and funded out of humanitarian budget lines should also be included in this indicator. It is not necessary to know on what beneficiaries spent the cash. The only criterion for inclusion is that the cash transfer programmeâs purpose is food security. Cash transfer programmes for improving food security should NOT also be double counted in the cash transfers indicator.","Food assistance is the biggest spend for DFID in humanitarian emergencies (both sudden onset and chronic). It will be used as a proxy for DFIDâs funding reach. It allows us to capture the coverage of our funding across emergencies to tell a global story about the scale of our emergency work. It does not allow us to talk about impact. While it will under-represent the number of people we reach with all of our funding, trying to get to a total number for emergency assistance across services is difficult as double- and triple-counting would be common with some beneficiaries receiving food, shelter and WASH services together.",Number of people reached with emergency food assistance through DFID support per year Indicator Type Peak Year (or cumulative if double-counting can be avoided),,Sex (where possible),,Not applicable - event driven,,,Monthly partner results reporting Mid-Year Reviews and Project Completion Reports,,,not available,,,,"i) Country offices need to select and state the single humanitarian intervention with the highest total number of beneficiaries reached with food assistance for at least one month for the reporting year.

The majority of the results are collated from partner agenciesâ reporting or management information systems and, as such, are subject to delays due to the time taken to complete and report on programmes. They are otherwise expected to be reasonably accurate and timely. There is some internal inconsistency as a result of some figures being cumulative and some peak year.

In the absence of a single survey which can disaggregate humanitarian food assistance, WASH, shelter, protection and health services, policy leads have suggested food assistance as a proxy. This provides an under-count but is preferable to triple-counting food assistance, WASH, and shelter. The original indicator referenced only number of people reached, with no reference to the duration of food aid. Both numbers of beneficiaries and duration of food aid are important to monitor, but a decision has been made to report only the number of people reached at this level of the framework and report months of food aid provided at a lower level.

The programmes contributing to this indicator tackle specific challenges to the security of rights to land and property, especially for the poor. For example, the lack of up to date and collectible land use and ownership information; the lack of delimitation or registration of communal land; or the lack of recognition of womenâs user and ownership rights. All of these make it more difficult for individuals and communities to get a good return from their assets. The indicator covers direct results measured through monitoring and evaluations at the project level. Indirect interventions - e.g. supporting policy changes and the wider enabling environment - could also be captured provided that robust estimates are made at the project level.

Improving maternal health is the fifth millennium development goal (MDG5). Associated target 5A is to reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio. Maternal deaths are caused by: -  haemorrhage (mainly post-partum) -  infection (usually after birth) -  high blood pressure (pre eclampsia and eclampsia) -  obstructed labour -  unsafe abortion, and -  disease (eg malaria, AIDS). Almost all maternal deaths (99%) occur in developing countries2 . Large differences exist in maternal mortality within and among countries; between rich and poor, and between urban and rural areas. Most maternal deaths are avoidable. They reflect a lack of access to skilled healthcare during the antenatal, birth, and postnatal periods. Improving maternal health will in turn reduce the risk of neonatal death. DFID considered three options for measuring maternal and newborn lives saved through DFID funding. These were: 1. internal DFID monitoring, 2. selecting through competitive tender an external provider to undertake the monitoring, and 3. direct contract with John Hopkins University to model results using LiST. Option 1 (internal DFID monitoring) was considered limited because data on maternal mortality are unavailable or not robust in many developing countries, particularly those which lack vital registration systems. Even where systems are in place, infrequent reporting renders it problematic to measure year-on-year progress towards the target. Option 2 (selecting through competitive tender an external provider to undertake the monitoring) was considered limited because of the delay in generating the first set of results and the significantly greater time requirement from DFID staff compared with other options. Option 3 (direct contract with John Hopkins University to model results using LiST) was considered the best option. Results are robust and credible within the global community, and could be generated within 1-2 months. Therefore DFIDâs results on maternal lives saved are obtained by modelling undertaken by partners at John Hopkins University using LiST. LiST generates country-specific estimates of maternal lives saved from information on DFIDâs health-related programmes, their coverage, the best scientific evidence on the effectiveness of interventions, and publicly available demographic, family planning, HIV and cause of death data. LiST was developed for the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF) over a period of 10 years by the child health epidemiology reference group (CHERG) and collaborators. Systematic reviews on the effectiveness of interventions that impact on maternal mortality informed the development of the tool3 .

No level,,Number of additional women using modern methods of family planning through DFID support,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Health,,"Overview: This outcome indicator measures DFIDâs contribution to the number of additional women using modern methods of family planning in each country. Country offices with reproductive health programmes, or which provide general or health sector budget support, should report results against this indicator. For each year, the total number of family planning users is estimated by applying the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) to the number of women aged 15-49 years. The difference between this figure and the total number of family planning users in the previous year gives the number of additional women using family planning. DFID attributed results are based on funding share. The results for each year are summed to generate the cumulative total over the DFID results framework (DRF) period of 5 years from financial year 2010/11 to financial year 2014/15. Definition: Modern methods of family planning include the pill, female and male sterilisation, intra-uterine device (IUD), injectable, implant, male and female condom, diaphragm, and emergency contraception. CPR is the percentage of women aged 15-49 years who are using, or whose partners are using, a modern method of contraception. To illustrate how the metric additional family planning users differs from new users, suppose that the total family planning users in year 1 is 100. Of these, 75 continue using contraception into year 2, and 25 stop using contraception. Suppose in year 2, there are 50 new users who were not using contraception in year 1. The total family planning users in year 2 comprises continuers and new users, 75 + 50 = 125. The additional users between year 2 and year 1 is the difference between the total number of users in these years, 125 - 100 = 25 The methodology set out in this note is used to calculate results obtained through our bilateral programmes. Published results against this indicator also include results from our multilateral and regional programmes, and civil society organisations, where the risk of double counting can reasonably be eliminated. See URL for graphics",Unmet need for family planning is a major barrier to development. This indicator is an outcome metric which is understood and used internationally to track progress towards meeting global unmet need for family planning following commitments at the family planning summit in 2012. The indicator takes account of maintaining supplies to existing users of family planning as well as reaching new users.,"Results are returned via a template on the DRF teamsite. Calculations, data sources and assumptions should be clearly explained in a supporting spreadsheet. Type of indicator: Cumulative ",,"No Ageor wealth disaggregation possible. Where possible, results should be given separately for adolescents Aged 15-19 years and those in the bottom two wealth quintiles. ","Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of results, as year-to-year changes in the number of additional users of family planning through DFID support may be driven by a combination of country-specific factors. A result greater than zero for additional users is likely to indicate DFID programming having successfully increased a countryâs CPR. However, positive results may also be due to an increase in population. Conversely, a negative number of additional users may indicate an underperforming programme; but could also be due to project completion or decreasing population. Variations in DFIDâs donor share will cause results to increase or decrease.","Country offices can determine the most suitable baseline for this indicator, depending on the timing of their reproductive health programmes and the availability of survey data. A baseline estimate of total family planning users is required for the calculation of this indicator under the standard methodology, as results are expressed in relation to the previous year. Baseline data on population and CPR will be useful to monitor progress under the intervention-versus-counterfactual methodology.",,,"CPR is available from household Surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and contraceptive prevalence Surveys. Population data can be obtained from official national statistics or United Nations (UN) Population Division. Information on DFID funding allocation is available from approved business cases. Information on the total government health budget is available from the annual progress report of the health sector or directly from the ministry of health. Where possible, actual expenditure rather than planned expenditure should be used.",,,See comments,,,"Country offices should provide twice-yearly returns of achieved results for financial years 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, and 2014/15, updating previous estimates as new information on population, CPR or DFID attribution becomes available.","Total family planning users = number of women aged 15-49 years X CPR Additional users = Difference in total family planning users between years DFID result = DFID attributable fraction X additional users Results are calculated for the whole country for each financial year 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, and 2014/15. If DFID is supporting only a specific geographical region within a country, the same method should be used, with CPR and population data corresponding to the specific geographical region. For years in which information on the number of women aged 15-49 years is not yet available, any reasonable method may be used to estimate it pending the publication of new population estimates: for example projections based on historical trend. For years in which there is no information on CPR, any reasonable method may be used to estimate it pending the results of the next survey: for example projections based on historical trend, or linearly interpolating between the most recent known rate and the target value. Age group and marital status should be consistent between CPR and population estimates. Ideally, calculations are based on the total number of women aged 15-49 years, whether married or unmarried. However, household surveys sometimes report CPR only for married women or women âin unionâ. If particular shocks occur within a country affecting supplies of contraceptives, it is acceptable to estimate additional family planning users as the difference between intervention and counterfactual (business as usual) scenarios. Justifications for assumptions, with evidence, should be given. DFIDâs attributable fraction is its donor share of family planning results. This is usually estimated from inputs, such as budget share. For sector budget support, either the overall health budget or the reproductive health budget is used, corresponding to DFIDâs contribution. DFIDâs attribution will vary from year to year as DFID, partner government or other donor spending changes. Where a substantial proportion of a countryâs family planning services are delivered in the private sector, it may not be possible to reliably estimate funding share. In countries where population data are unavailable or unreliable, the funding share is unknown, or the main DFID financing modality is direct funding to service delivery programmes, this indicator is estimated from programme data or management information. DFID reports results in UK financial years (April to March). Where country data relate to calendar years or some other division, the closest period to DFIDâs financial year should be used without adjustment. For example, 2013 calendar year data would be reported under DFIDâs 2013/14 financial year.","This outcome level indicator is considered highly relevant for measuring global access to contraceptives, because it takes account of maintaining supplies to existing users as well as reaching new users. It is an internationally coherent metric which is used to track progress towards meeting global unmet need for family planning following commitments at the family planning summit in 2012. Sixteen DFID country offices, one multilateral programme, one regional programme and two civil society organisations contribute towards this indicator from reproductive health programmes or general/health budget support. Results are considered to be moderately accurate overall. Accuracy is good in countries with recent demographic and health surveys (DHS), reliable population estimates and where DFIDâs share of funding for family planning can be established. The indicator is much more difficult to measure, and likely to be inaccurate, where these things are not in place. Where results are based on surveys which only take place every three to five years, there may be long time lags in obtaining data. Coherence is problematic where country offices or partners are unable to effectively measure the required indicator, and therefore use a proxy such as new users. There are no concerns in terms of cost or confidentiality.","There may be a considerable lag in verifying achieved results, as surveys only take place every 3-5 years.","There are four layers of quality assurance (QA) in place, not including any processes put in place by partners or implementers. 1. Country offices assess data quality during annual reviews and project completion reviews. 2. Country offices comment on the quality of their data being reported in the DRF, and provide a link to the calculations spreadsheet. 3. Policy Division check the DRF return and the calculations, and record any issues in a QA log. 4. Finance and Corporate Performance Division review the QA log to ensure resolution of issues.",,"Alternatives to the standard methodology are an intervention-versuscounterfactual methodology, or using management information or programme data to measure results.","1. Standard methodology Official statistics recorded 100,000 women aged 15-49 years for the baseline year 2009, as shown in the table. The historical trend was used to estimate the equivalent population in each subsequent year pending new data. The most recent household survey reported CPR of 40percentage in 2009. The reproductive health programme is intended to increase CPR to 50percentage by 2014. Estimates of CPR are linearly interpolated for intervening years pending new survey data. DFID supported 10percentage of the countryâs health budget in 2010, 8percentage in 2011 and 5percentage in subsequent years.  2. Intervention versus counterfactual methodology Official statistics recorded 100,000 women aged 15-49 years for the baseline year 2009, as shown in the table. The historical trend was used to estimate the equivalent population in each subsequent year pending new data. The most recent household survey reported CPR of 40percentage in 2009. The reproductive health programme is intended to increase CPR to 50percentage by 2014. Estimates of CPR under the intervention scenario are linearly interpolated for intervening years pending new survey data. DFID and other donors prevented a national stock-out of contraceptives in 2010. Under the counterfactual scenario, CPR is assumed to drop to 35percentage in 2010 then increase in line with regional trends. DFID supported 10percentage of the reproductive health programme in 2010, 8percentage in 2011 and 5percentage in subsequent years. DFIDâs results for each year, pending updated population and CPR data, are entered in the DRF return. The annual results are added together to give the cumulative total for the DRF period.

No level,,Newborn lives saved,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Health,Maternal Health and Newborn Care,"This indicator measures DFIDâs contribution to the number of newborn lives saved. It considers the impact of programmes on reproductive, maternal and newborn health (RMNH); human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); malaria; other health; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); nutrition; humanitarian assistance; and general and health sector budget support. Because mortality data are reported infrequently, results on this indicator are obtained by modelling. Country offices complete a data collection template with information on each of their relevant programmes obtained from logframes and annual reviews. John Hopkins University has been contracted to run the estimation of lives saved from the information provided in the data collection template, using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST)1 . For bilateral general or health sector budget support, the model estimates DFIDâs contribution to the results based on DFIDâs funding share. For support to specific programmes, the model estimates DFIDâs contribution to the results as 100% where DFID is solely responsible for delivery; or as the appropriate funding share where DFID works in partnership with other agencies.","Definition: newborn (neonatal) mortality is the death of a live-born baby within 28 days of birth. Reducing child mortality is the fourth millennium development goal (MDG4). Its associated target is to reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the underfive mortality rate. More than 40% of deaths in children younger than 5 years occur during the neonatal period2 . Therefore reducing these deaths is an important element of achieving the planned reduction in under-five mortality. Factors influencing the risk of neonatal death include maternal health, antenatal care, management of pregnancy/birth complications, hygiene during and after delivery, and care of the baby3 . Many of these factors have strong cultural determinants, which need to be taken into account when planning interventions to reduce mortality. For example, women may have low status in society and inadequate nutritional status at conception. They may have their first child at a young age, and go on to have a high number of closely-spaced pregnancies. Practices such as inadequate cord care, leaving the baby wet and cold, discarding colostrum and inappropriate feeding may be widespread3 .DFID considered three options for measuring maternal and newborn lives saved through DFID funding. These were: 1. internal DFID monitoring, 2. selecting through competitive tender an external provider to undertake the monitoring, and 3. direct contract with John Hopkins University to model results using LiST.

No level,,"Number of children under five, breastfeeding and pregnant women reached through DFIDâs nutrition-relevant programmes",DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Health,Maternal Health and Newborn Care,"These refer to those programmes that have specific nutrition objectives, outputs or outcomes. For example, these can range from sector support programmes in health or agriculture, to specific micro-nutrient provision programmes. This indicator should include the results of: -  Direct Interventions - based on the Lancetâs proven interventions1 : -  Nutrition sensitive programmes - where the logical frameworks report against a nutrition outcome / objective for under-fives and/or pregnant or breastfeeding women2 . This can include: health, sanitation, livelihoods, education, agriculture and womenâs empowerment programmes that explicitly aim to impact on nutrition (alongside other goals). The panel below provides a definition of nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions and programmes. The annual reach of these programmes should be measured as follows: -  Where the programme directly targets under 5s and/or pregnant/breastfeeding women and management information is available regarding reach, the numbers should be taken directly from programme information. -  Where the programme targets a wider age group, it is necessary to determine the size of the population to whom the programme is available and the size of the population actually accessing the programme (coverage). The number of under 5s reached can then be estimated using the percentage of under 5s in the wider age group from routine population statistics. -  The number of breastfeeding mothers and pregnant women should be counted if data are already available. Breastfeeding is a challenging indicator to measure and country offices/partners should NOT start new surveys in order to count breastfeeding mothers, so alternatives are: o Breastfeeding prevalence (from Demographic and Health Surveys or similar datasets) can be used to estimate the percentage of new mothers who are breastfeeding their children up to the age of 6 months. o If those data are not available, the number of mothers of children up to 6 months who are reached by nutrition services is a proxy measure. This will often only require that the pregnant women continue to be counted for 6 months minus the mortality numbers for babies aged less than 6 months. -  If the programme was funded by multiple donors or was a form of sector / budget support, the total number of children should be calculated based on the proportion of DFID funding provided. The reach of these programmes refers to unique, individual children aged under 5 and breastfeeding/pregnant women. It is important to ensure that there is no double counting between nutrition sensitive and direct nutrition programmes. In this sense, we are counting the number of people reached, not the number of interventions. So, for example, even if someone receives 20 different interventions through a multitude of programmes - the reach is still 1 person. In particular: -  Where there are non-continuous programmes, the peak number of unique children and/or pregnant/breastfeeding women receiving the programme over the year should be recorded. -  Where there are continuous programmes, the number of unique children and breastfeeding/pregnant women in the latest period should be recorded. Where countries have multiple programmes, they should: -  Return the total unique reach of the programmes if known. -  Otherwise, they should return the sum of the reach of each programme along with an estimate of the percentage of the estimated overlap between programmes. It is also important to avoid double counting in persons reached over time. Where country offices can identify or undertake a reliable estimation for unique children and pregnant or breastfeeding women across years then, in year 1, country offices should identify unique pregnant or breastfeeding women and children reached and in year 2 they should aim to identify additional children and pregnant or breastfeeding women that were not supported in year 1 and add this to the total from year 1. This ensures we are only counting unique individuals reached over time. This approach should be repeated in all later years. Where country offices cannot reliably estimate unique children and pregnant/breastfeeding women across years then they should simply return annual figures of the number of unique children and pregnant or breastfeeding women reached in each year. These figures should not be added up across years due to the likelihood that programmes will reach some of the same children or women each year. Breastfeeding women and their children should only both be counted if both are direct recipients of an intervention. For example, if breastfeeding women are receiving nutritional support and their children are also receiving a specific intervention then both should be counted. However, if breastfeeding women are being targeted but the children are not receiving an intervention only the breastfeeding women should be counted. The children of these women will potentially be indirect beneficiaries of the programme but should not be included to avoid double counting. The methodology set out in this note is used to calculate results obtained through our bilateral programmes. Published results against this indicator also include results from our core contributions to relevant multilateral agencies, where the risk of double counting can reasonably be eliminated.",Estimates the number of children and pregnant/breastfeeding women reached through DFIDâs nutrition-relevant programmes.

The final numbers and calculations are then quality assured by DFID HQ. Where a Country Office is supporting a national-level food fortification programme, they are advised to contact the nutrition adviser in Human Development Department to discuss reach estimates before they are submitted to the centre. This is to ensure that an appropriate methodology is being applied.","For general and sector budget support and general financial aid projects, the calculation is: = x Estimated proportion of costs per pupil funded by DFID (1)/(2) -  The coverage of expenditure data for the DFID spend (1) and Total government and donor spend (2) should be aligned as closely as possible to each other. For example: if DFID is only supporting primary and lower secondary, the total government and donor spend should also be restricted to primary and lower secondary. -  The years selected for enrolment and expenditure data should be matched as closely as possible with the time frame for the DFID DRF (April - March), and with each other (where academic and financial years differ), and should be the latest data available. However there is no need to pro-rata across years if (3) Total number of children enrolled in primary school Total number of children supported by DFID (2) Total Government and donor spend on [primary] education (1) DFID spend on [primary] education there is some mismatched. -  DFIDâs expenditure should include all sector budget support and general financial aid to education, and the share of general budget support according to the proportion of Government spend going to education. -  All DFID and other development partnersâ general and education-specific expenditure should be included in the Governmentsâ expenditure denominator (2) wherever possible, even if offbudget. -  The enrolment data should also correspond as closely as possible to the areas of education supported by DFID. In most cases this would mean all enrolments in publically funded schools, and care should be taken to exclude any private enrolments. -  In some countries household contributions to education may be large, which will overstate DFIDâs share of education spend. However, household spend on education should not be counted in expenditure calculations, as this would be inconsistently recorded across countries and years. -  DFID spend on education from General Budget Support should use the calculations for the attribution of General Budget Support set out in the relevant general guidance note. For project fundingIdeally the calculation would be the same as for budget support, with the DFID funding (1), total Government and donor spend (2) and pupil numbers (3) restricted to the pupils or schools covered by the Project. Where the total costs of schooling is unknown, we should try to estimate our proportion of the costs of a supported pupilâs schooling ((1)/(2)) using other available data (such as using overall average cost per pupil in Government schools) If it is not possible to do the calculations above, then we can count beneficiaries of projects where DFID support is âcriticalâ i.e. where schooling would not have occurred without DFID support. For example, if a DFID project results in additional children attending school, these additional children can be counted in the calculation. Or if we can prove that no learning would have occurred without DFID support, then these children can also be counted in the calculation. We can also count pupils where we are confident that we fund the majority of their costs, even if this is not quite 100%. Although ideally we should make some estimate of the percentage of the cost funded by DFID. -  If DFID is supporting private education we should use the same calculation, but restrict the total spend and enrolment to the private schools being supporting by DFID. If we are funding 100% of the cost of the pupil through vouchers we can count each pupil funded. -  Where enrolment is collected regularly by projects, enrolment numbers should ideally be the average of the relevant DFID DRF time period, or taken as close as possible to the mid point of the DRF time period (Sept each year). The exception is when a project is set up so our funding increases in proportion to increases in enrolment, in which case enrolment numbers can be taken as close as possible to, but not after, the end point of the DRF time period (March each year). -  Ideally project enrolment data should follow the same methodology as the national EMIS, to support comparability between countries and projects. -  If we jointly fund a project, we should take care to only take the DFID proportion of funds in calculating our share. Totals In most cases the final numbers of children supported would be the sum of the total number of children supported by general and sector budget support, plus the numbers supported by individual projects. Care should be taken to avoid double counting. So children supported through a specific project should be excluded if all or most would also be covered through another project or programme. Or the numbers should be adjusted by the expected number covered by another project where there is a clear overlap. This should include consideration of pupils enrolled in more than one school (eg both a public and private school). However, in the case of general budget or sector support which reaches all children, when reasonable we will assume that the proportion of the pupils supported by DFID through general budget or sector support are different to those supported by individual projects. Hence numbers of children supported by targeted individual projects can be added to the number supported by general or sector budget support, even if a small proportion of budget support could in theory also reach the children supported by targeted projects. Forecasts and achieved results Country Offices are asked to provide two main returns: one is the results achieved to date; and the second is the best available forecast for March 2015. The former follows the methodology set out here. The latter (the forecast) takes the results achieved to date and provides a best estimate of what is likely to be achieved by March 2015. The methodology for doing this should be decided by each country, but would normally be some extrapolation of progress to date, taking into account expected changes in funding and policy in the future.",,"The timeliness of the data varies across countries. Data from routine monitoring systems may be available on a regular basis in-year. Administrative or census data may have a time lag of several years. Evaluation data are likely to have a lag of at least one year.

International","There are three layers of quality assurance (QA) in place, not including any processes put in place by partners or implementers. 1. Country Offices comment on the quality of the data (see annex A), and provide a link to the calculations spreadsheet, in their return. In addition, Country Offices also assess data quality used during Annual Reviews and Project Completion Reviews and some conduct field visits, evaluations or triangulate data with other sources. Some offices also use third party monitors to conduct verifications in areas which it is not safe for DFID to visit. 2. Policy divisions check the return, and the calculations, and record any issues in a QA log. 3. FCPD review the QA log to ensure resolution of issues.","There is potential for double counting of children reached across a number of years, given that many programmes provide support to children over a five year period. Given the methodology looks at peak year contributions and calculates annually, not cumulatively, it should be possible to avoid this. Coverage may be difficult to determine in nutrition education campaigns, e.g. through the radio or other media.",,"Worked Example: DFID is directly supporting vitamin A distribution at child health weeks. These are expected to reach the entire under 5 population of the country (around 1 million under 5s in any given year). DFID provides 10percentage of the funding for this programme and therefore can claim 100,000 under 5s reached with vitamin A supplements in year 1. In year 2, roughly 20percentage of the children under 5 in year 1 will have moved out of that age group, with the remaining 80percentage receiving the supplement again. This 80percentage should not be counted again in year 2. However, 200,000 new 0-1 year olds will have entered this population in year 2. Therefore in year 2, DFID will have reached an additional 20,000 unique children. Similarly in years 3 and 4. Therefore by the end of year 4, DFID will have reached 1.6m unique under 5s with vitamin A interventions.",,,,https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/540053/nutrition3.pdf,None.,
No level,,Number of children supported by DFID in primary education (per annum),DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Education,,"Overview: Measures the total number of children in primary education who are only in school because of DFID support, broken down by sex. This mainly consists of the number of children which DFID fully funds in primary school. When it is not possible to calculate this number (usually fortargeted project interventions, or when the total education budget is not known), then this counts the number of children estimated to only be in school because of DFID support. This does not include an assessment of the quality of education or attendance at school, and does not include all of DFIDâs support to education. Targeted project interventions (eg on improving learning) which do not comprehensively cover a childâs education are oftenexcluded.  Definition: When possible, the methodology is a pro-rata share of enrolment, where the share is calculated as DFIDâs contribution to the education budget for the relevant schools or pupils. First the percentage of total education spend on a set of primary schools or pupils covered by DFID is estimated. This is usually the DFID total spend on the relevant primary schools or pupils divided by the total (Government and donor) spend on the relevant primary schools or pupils. Secondly, this percentage of spend covered by DFID is multiplied by the total number of children enrolled in the relevant primary schools. For general and sector budget support, and most education financial aid projects, this would be the total DFID spend on [primary] education divided by the total Government and donor spend on [primary] education, multiplied by the total enrolments in publically funded primary schools. In some cases the pro-rata share of enrolment is not possible or meaningful to calculate (eg because the total education budget is unknown for a subset of schools, or a DFID project is not aimed at fully funding a childâs education). In this case, pupils can be counted if we have evidence that the child would not be in school or not learning at all without DFIDâs support. In this case the children supported would be calculated from project specific evaluations or data sets (eg using the number of additional enrolments as a result of the DFID programme). With jointly funded programmes, a pro-rata share of these additional enrolments should be calculated using DFIDâs share of the programme funding.",Estimates the number of children supported by DFID in the primary school system in any one academic year. This enables DFID to attribute what its education aid investment buys in terms of access to primary education. Increasing DFID financial support or increasing access to primary education could both result in an increased number supported.,"Number of children supported by DFID in primary education per year, disaggregated by sex, along with a record of workings. In particular, any deviations from the standard methodology described in this note should be clearly highlighted.",,Sex,"The number of children supported by DFIDâs can fluctuate for a number of reasons. This could be a sign of improved performance due to: -  An increase in enrolment, or -  A decrease in unit costs It could also indicate increases in DFID expenditure in education or general budget support. But it could also be due to other factors, which may not be related to improved performance. For example, a decrease in Government spending on education could increase the number of children supported by DFID without a real increase in performance or enrolment. Similarly, decreases in the number supported by DFID could also be a sign of decreases in enrolment or increases in unit costs, or just reflect decreases in DFID spending on education or budget support, or increases in Government spending. In some cases variations could reflect changes in the methodology of the EMIS or expenditure data. Hence fluctuations in the number should be interpreted carefully. This indicator focuses on funding and enrolments. Hence it does not give an indication of the quality of the education, or of whether and how much a child is actually attending school. This is because of the problems of internationally comparable data in these areas. DFID is looking into additional indicators for the future which could cover these important areas. DFID is also supporting better national and international measures to assess student attainment and learning outcomes. For this reason this indicator should be considered alongside other measures of effective education performance including the completion of primary education, and - where available - country specific learning data. The indicator excludes consideration of household expenditure on education, as it is not currently possible to include this in a meaningful and consistent way. This would lead to the indicator overestimating DFIDâs contribution. The indicator also excludes DFIDâs influence over and above its financial contribution (eg on policy and national programmes), which is likely to be substantial in many countries. This would lead to the indicator underestimating DFIDâs contribution. The indicator is counting the number of pupils supported in a given year: it is not possible to capture unique children. Hence we are not able to sum the number of children supported in each year to give a total number of unique children supported across the DRF time period (as this would double count children). However, this indicator may be added to the corresponding indicator of the number DFID supports in lower secondary to give a total for basic education: a priority focus for DFID education support.",Data is available or forecast from 2009/10 to 2014/15. DFID wide performance will be based on the total of the maximum number of children supported in each country between 2009/10 and the latest available year (for results to date) and 2009/10 to 2014/15 for the 2015 forecast.,,,,,,Annual ,,,DFID Country Offices select the most relevant data and calculations and submit these to the DFID HQ.

No level,,Number of DFID supported countries showing improvement in the proportion of children that can read with sufficient fluency for comprehension in early grades,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Education,,"Overview: Counts the number of DFID supported countries which demonstrate improved early grade reading outcomes overtime.  Definition: This will be based on the number of countries that measure oral reading fluency at least twice between 2009/10 and 2014/15, and counts the number of countries showing an improvement over this time period.","This indicator enables DFID to better understand and track performance on learning outcomes in its partner countries. Where DFID is providing budget or sector support, it provides a proxy for how well DFID is supporting improved learning. This enables DFID to track implementation of its latest policy, which puts learning at the heart of its support to education. Early grade reading is an indicator of the quality of an education system, and literacy is a pre-requisite for learning in all other subjects. Assessing literacy at an early grade (e.g. Grade 2 or 3) is still early enough for governments to take remedial action to improve teaching and learning.","Proportion of children reading with fluency, along with: type of assessment/data source; date of assessment; sampling frame; language of assessment; grade; and any specific quality or measurement issues. Type of indicator: annual",,Sex (whenever possible),"Learning data in many countries is patchy, but improving. As a result many DFID focus countries may not have the time series of data needed to report on this indicator. DFID is actively working with partner government and other stakeholders to increase the availability of early grade learning assessment data. In most cases an improvement in the indicator for a particular country will reflect improved reading of children in early grades; which could be due to improved teaching methods, class sizes, resources etc. The indicator is focused on learning outcomes of children in school. In some countries learning outcomes may be affected by large changes in enrolment. Hence a decrease in the proportion with good learning outcomes for those children in school may still represent an improvement in 4 learning outcomes across all children, if more children are attending school. Whenever relevant and possible, this will be noted. Similarly an increase may reflect a reduction in enrolment. A country is counted in the indicator if there has been any improvement in the result. It does not take into account whether this improvement is statistically significant, although this should balance out across countries.","The baseline for each country is the earliest data available from 2009/10. The data was first collected from country offices in 2011. Countries are counted if they have two comparable data points between 2009/10 and 2014/15.

If so, it selects the most relevant data and calculations and submits these to the DFID HQ. The final numbers and calculations are then quality assured by DFID HQ.","Early Grade Reading is not an internationally standardised education indicator and so the methodology will differ across countries. For a country to be included in the result, they will have to carry out at least two sample based assessments of reading fluency or comprehension in early grades (Grades 2-4) between 2009-10 and 2014-15. The two assessments should be comparable to enable an assessment of trends over time. This means the assessments should be conducted in a comparable way across the time points, both in terms of the questions asked and the methodology. The assessment could be conducted by any local partner (Government, development partner or NGO). Results from the first and latest assessments will be compared to identify any improvements. The assessments should ideally be nationally representative. If this is not available, data that is representative of a significant part of the country (eg a key state) can be used. In this case the coverage of the data should be clearly stated in the Country Office return. Each country is asked to report data on the proportion of children that can read with sufficient fluency for 2 comprehension in early grades. The most commonly used methodology will be the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA). This includes a connected text oral reading fluency test which measures the childrenâs ability to read a story created to be appropriate for particular regions and targeted at grade 2. The test lasts for one minute, and the number of words read correctly is recorded. Children are usually assessed at the end of Grade 2, or early in Grade 3. The methodology requires the Government or DFID country office to establish - ideally in advance of data collection - a benchmark for the level of fluency (words per minute read correctly) required for comprehension. On average this is around 45-65 words per minute, but varies depending on the language. The proportion of children who read more words correctly than this agreed benchmark is used to track progress on this indicator. The indicator should focus on the most commonly used language of instruction for a country or region. This would normally be the main local language. Where regions have different main languages of instruction, the test should ideally be conducted in the main language in each region, with the results amalgamated using school age population weights. If oral reading fluency data is not available, it is also possible to use other indicators of reading fluency or comprehension. For example the number of comprehension questions answered correctly, compared to an agreed benchmark If using an UWEZO assessment, as another example, the indicator: âthe percentage of children in a higher grade who can read and comprehend an early grade level storyâ could be used. In Kenya this would have been based on the % of children in Classes 4 or 5 who correctly answered two basic comprehension questions after reading a Class 2 level paragraph.",,Survey data can have a time lag of a year or more from collection to publication.,International assessments are normally quality assured by the supporting partner (eg USAID for EGRA).

No level,,"Number of births delivered with the help of nurses, midwives or doctors through DFID support",DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,Health,Maternal Health and Newborn Care,"Overview: This outcome indicator measures DFIDâs contribution to the number of births that have been attended by a skilled birth attendant (SBA) in each country.Country offices with maternal or newborn health programmes, or which provide general or health sector budget support, should report results against this indicator. For each year, the number of births attended by an SBA is estimated by applying the SBA coverage rate to the number of births. DFID attributed results are based on funding share. The results for each year are summed to generate the cumulative total over the DFID results framework (DRF) period of 5 years from financial year 2010/11 to financial year 2014/15. Definiton: WHO defines a Skilled Birth Attendant as âan accredited health professional - such as a midwife, doctor or nurse - who has been educated and trained to proficiency in the skills needed to manage normal (uncomplicated) pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and in the identification, management and referral of complications in women and newbornsâ. The definition of SBA used in practice may not be entirely consistent between countries. The total number of births in a year should be taken account of in the calculation, including stillbirths, non-institutional births and each baby from a multiple birth. The methodology set out in this note is used to calculate results obtained through our bilateral programmes. Published results against this indicator also include results from civil society organisations, where the risk of double counting can reasonably be eliminated.",Maternal and newborn mortality remains unacceptably high in many developing countries. A major factor in these deaths is the lack of a skilled attendant at childbirth. This indicator is an outcome metric which is understood and used internationally as a proxy measure of progress towards millennium development goal (MDG) 4 on child mortality and MDG 5 on maternal health.,"Results are returned via a template on the DRF teamsite. Calculations, data sources and assumptions should be clearly explained in a supporting spreadsheet. Tyoe of indicator: Cumulative",,"No Ageor wealth disaggregation possible. Where possible, results should be given separately for adolescents Aged 15-19 years and those in the bottom two wealth quintiles. ","Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of results, as year-to-year changes in the number of births attended by SBA through DFID support may be driven by a combination of country-specific factors. An increase over time is likely to indicate DFID programming having successfully increased a countryâs SBA coverage rate. However, increased results may also be due to a greater number of births or an increase in DFIDâs donor share. Conversely, a decrease over time may indicate an underperforming programme; but could also be due to project completion, a falling birth rate or a decrease in DFIDâs attributable fraction.","Country offices can determine the most suitable baseline for this indicator, depending on the timing of their maternal and newborn health programmes and the availability of survey data. Baseline results are not required for the calculation of this indicator, as results are not expressed in relation to the previous year. However, baseline data on births and SBA coverage will be useful to monitor progress.",,,,,,See comments,,,"Country offices should provide twice-yearly returns of achieved results for financial years 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, and 2014/15, updating previous estimates as new information on births, SBA coverage or DFID attribution becomes available.","Number of births attended by SBA = number of births X SBA coverage rate DFID result = DFID attributable fraction X number of births attended by SBA Results are calculated for the whole country for each financial year 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, and 2014/15. If DFID is supporting only a specific geographical region within a country, the same method should be used, with SBA coverage and number of births corresponding to the specific geographical region. For years in which information on births is not yet available, any reasonable method may be used to estimate it pending the publication of new population estimates: for example projections based on historical trend. For years in which there is no information on SBA coverage, any reasonable method may be used to estimate it pending the results of the next survey: for example projections based on historical trend, or linearly interpolating between the most recent known rate and the target value. DFIDâs attributable fraction is its donor share of SBA results. This is usually estimated from inputs, such as budget share. For sector budget support, either the overall health budget or the maternal and newborn health budget is used, corresponding to DFIDâs contribution. DFIDâs attribution will vary from year to year as DFID, partner government or other donor spending changes. In countries where population data are unavailable or unreliable, the funding share is unknown, or the main DFID financing modality is direct funding to service delivery programmes, this indicator is estimated from programme data or management information. DFID reports results in UK financial years (April to March). Where country data relate to calendar years or some other division, the closest period to DFIDâs financial year should be used without adjustment. For example, 2013 calendar year data would be reported under DFIDâs 2013/14 financial year.","This outcome level indicator is considered highly relevant. Skilled attendance during childbirth is one of the critical interventions to reduce maternal mortality. Maternal mortality ratios are insensitive to short term changes, hence the need for a proxy indicator to measure progress towards MDG 5. Nineteen DFID country offices and one civil society organisation contribute towards this indicator from programmes on maternal and newborn health or general/health budget support. Results are considered to be moderately accurate overall. Accuracy is good in countries with recent demographic and health surveys, reliable vital registration systems and where DFIDâs share of funding for maternal and newborn health can be established. The indicator is much more difficult to measure, and likely to be inaccurate, where these things are not in place. Where results are based on surveys which only take place every three to five years, there may be long time lags in obtaining data. Coherence is problematic where country offices or partners are unable to effectively measure the required indicator, and therefore use a proxy such as institutional births. Furthermore, there may be inter-country differences in the definition of SBA affecting coherence. There are no concerns in terms of cost or confidentiality.","There may be a considerable lag in verifying achieved results, as surveys only take place every 3-5 years.","There are four layers of quality assurance (QA) in place, not including any processes put in place by partners or implementers. 1. Country offices assess data quality during annual reviews and project completion reviews. 2. Country offices comment on the quality of their data being reported in the DRF, and provide a link to the calculations spreadsheet. 3. Policy Division check the DRF return and the calculations, and record any issues in a QA log. 4. Finance and Corporate Performance Division review the QA log to ensure resolution of issues.",,"Using institutional births, live births or maternities in the calculation (rather than all births) will underestimate the required indicator.","A country recorded 1,000 births for the baseline year 2009, as shown in the table. UN Population Division medium variant population projections were used to estimate the number of births in each subsequent year pending new population data.

No level,,"Number of unique people reached with one or more water, sanitation or hygiene promotion intervention",DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,"Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)",,"The bilateral results attributable to DFID will be the number of women, children and men who individually benefit from one or more of the three possible DFID supported WASH services: 1) sustainable access to clean drinking water; 2) sustainable access to improved sanitation; 3) access to improved hygiene. The preferred data source for the WASH indicators is programme data on direct beneficiaries and this should capture only individuals who have gained access to WASH services as defined within the methodologies which they did not previously have. If alternative data sources are used, care must also be taken to establish the counterfactual - i.e. the number or proportion of people reached with WASH interventions who already had access according to the definitions outlined in the methodology notes. This may not always be clear-cut. In the case of providing access to safe drinking water in urban areas, for example, individuals reached with the intervention may already have had some access to clean water but this access is now improved (and is now available perhaps for longer periods of time, at a smaller distance or as a protected source). The judgement is whether the level of access has improved from not meeting the definitions within the methodology notes to now meeting the definitions after the intervention. Please make conservative estimates in this respect and contact the WASH policy team if clarification is required. An individual benefiting from more than one of the WASH interventions can be only counted once in the results for this indicator. This is the case even if the same individual benefits from multiple interventions in different years (that individual must still only be counted once). This can be reflected in the results reporting template by ensuring that double counting is avoided in the figures reported for the combined indicator (applying the same principles as those for avoiding double counting in the same year - see the data calculations section). However, not every individual need have access to all three interventions in order to be counted. Some people will get only one intervention, some will get two and some will receive all three interventions. The water and sanitation indicators refer to sustainability in the indicator names. Measuring sustainability is challenging and would require monitoring well beyond the timespan of the DFID Results Framework. It therefore is not possible to require that all interventions are verified as sustainable. However, sustainability should be considered within project design and monitoring. Note that unlike the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), the WASH indicators measure access rather than use. In this sense, the indicators are generally aligned with other DFID Results Framework indicators which are pitched at output rather than outcome level. Measuring use and attributing the results to DFID would be challenging and potentially more subjective. This results indicator is a composite indicator and this note only defines how to produce the composite data. The monitoring of individual interventions is outlined in the three specific indicator methodology notes (key sections of which are included as an Annex here). The results for the WASH composite indicator should combine data from the three individual indicators. How this is done will depend on available data, as set out in the âdata calculationsâ section below.","Rationale for a combined indicator: In April 2012 the Secretary of State for International Development made a commitment to provide 60 million people with access to sustainable WASH. This commitment is included in The Coalition: together in the national interest (2013). This target supersedes the three targets outlined in Changing Lives, Delivering Results (2011). As WASH services are integrated, in some cases the same people received more than one service. A single figure, capturing the number of individuals reached through either one or a combination of WASH inputs with DFID support, is the chosen measure of our overall impact. Data on the number of people reached with each of the three WASH inputs will also continue to be recorded because it is necessary in order to calculate the composite indicator, because it is useful contextual information on DFIDâs WASH programmes, and to ensure a continued high standard of transparency in our reporting to the UK public. Water supply: Lack of water supply has negative impacts on poverty reduction, gender equity, child health and education. Ensuring everyone has access to a safe water supply is a high priority for the coalition government. Sanitation: Lack of sanitation has negative impacts on child health, nutritional outcomes and education. Ensuring everyone has access to and uses sanitation is a high priority for the coalition government. Hygiene: Hand washing with soap can reduce the prevalence of diarrhoea by 42-49%. Diarrhoea is the second greatest killer of children across the globe today and the number one cause of death in children in the continent of Africa. Good hygiene also protects against acute respiratory infections. Face and hand washing are also essential in preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases such as trachoma.","Number of unique people reached with one or more water, sanitation or hygiene promotion intervention. Type of indicator: Composite (combination of the three sub-indicators) and Cumulative (annual results are reported and summed over the entire reporting period, assuming that each individual is counted within one year only).",,"Data should be reported separately on the numbers of people provided with access to improved water supply, improved sanitation, and improved hygiene. There is space for this and to report on this combined indicator in the results template. Women and girls are most severely affected by the lack of adequate WASH. At the household level it is expected that all family members would benefit from the provision of the facility and therefore it may not make sense to Sex disaggregate. Where there are specific Gender impacts or issues (for example, a project aiming to increase access to sanitation for women and girls), data should be disaggregated by Sex to the extent possible. Whilst this is not a requirement for DRF reporting, the MDG target indicator disaggregates data according to rural/urban and so this data should be collected wherever possible for the purposes of monitoring. Data should also be disaggregated by Agewhere possible for this purpose.",,"Baselines vary by country and âresults achieved between baseline and milestone 1â should be reported in the DRF template in addition to results for 2011/12 onwards where applicable. For projects, baseline data should be collected at the start of the project.",,Good performance will be if the project is on track to meet the targets set out in the logframe.,"Provision should be included in projects and programmes for the collection of data on improved WASH directly attributable to the intervention. This will normally be the primary source of data. Where water and sanitation results are delivered through nonspecific WASH programmes, for instance health, education, social development or livelihoods, projects will need to collect WASH data in addition to other project data. Data on household size, where needed, should be determined from recent national census data or from a nationally representative household Survey. In the case of sector and budget support, output level data on the three separate WaSH indicators is the preferred starting point before attributing DFIDâs share of results. If this is not available, national statistical data should be used but in this case, funding in the sector from other sources should be considered in addition to the government budget when calculating DFIDâs share of total expenditure. Water and sanitation coverage is a key indicator that we would expect to be included in partner countries national statistical record and which would provide the basic data required. The Joint Monitoring Programme of WHO/UNICEF (http://www.wssinfo.org/) publishes a report every 2 years using data on use of improved water supply and basic sanitation from Surveys and censuses. The resulting international database of coverage provides a useful reference to assess the validity of country data (but should not be used as a primary source as the indicators measure usage and programme output level data is preferred). Where we are funding through multilateral partners at a country level, they should be requested to collect WASH specific data to demonstrate results achieved.",,"Census, Surveys",not available,,,"Country offices should report this on this indicator through the DFID Results Framework data collection system. In reporting on this indicator the country office will take primary responsibility for ensuring adequate baseline data is available and that programmes include suitable indicators and requirements for regular measurement. Where direct budget support or sector support is being provided, country offices should determine the share of national results that can be attributed to DFID support (see general guidance on the DRF teamsite). Use of programme data on output level results (access to WASH services) is preferred.","Two issues arise in calculating the number of uniquepeople withsustainable access to one or moreWASH services as a resultof DFID support. More than one programme may target the same Geographical area and the same people may receive more than one type of WaSH intervention. (1)If detailed information is available on WASH services received, compile a list of communities (with populations) where WaSH programmes (which may be overlapping) operate and categorise them using the matrix of the 7 possible interventions below. For each category sum the population being served by each intervention or combination of interventions. Summing the total from each category then provides the total number of unique beneficiaries, ensuring that people receiving more than one intervention are counted once only.Example A WASH programme provides 140,000 people with access to clean water, 60,000 with access to sanitation and 160,000 with hygiene education. In terms of the categories above, project data shows that we have the following numbers of people: Hygiene only: 50,000 Water only: 40,000 Sanitation only: 25,000 Water and hygiene: 75,000 Sanitation and hygiene: 10,000 Water, sanitation and hygiene: 25,000 The total number of unique people receiving WASH services is 225,000 (the total of these categories). (2)If detailed information is not available for analysis of services received, estimate the size of the population for which the programmes overlap and take only the highest figure from each type of WaSH intervention for the populations concerned. Example: fully overlapping programmes or one programme providing a range of WaSH interventions DFIDâs funding to the UNICEF Water and Health programme in Eritrea will provide sustainable access to an improved sanitation facility for 90,000 people and sustainable access to water for 20,000 people. The people provided with water and sanitation access will be in the same six regions of Eritrea, so we assume the results could largely or fully overlap. The larger figure of 90,000 people is used as a conservative estimate of unique people reached with access to water, sanitation or both. Example: partly overlapping programmes Two programmes exist as follows within the same country: Water: 100,000 people Sanitation: 80,000 people These two programmes overlap Geographically and it is not possible to determine how many people receive only water, only sanitation or both. If the programmes only partly overlap Geographically, the results could be scaled accordingly using the percentage overlap. For example, if only 25% of the sanitation results above are achieved in the same regions as the water results, the total result recorded should be 160,000 people calculated as follows: Highest result (water = 100,000) + non-overlapping sanitation result (60,000 = 75% of 80,000) = 160,000 See URL  von chart",,Data collection and analysis is likely to take a minimum of six to twelve months. Results achieved in previous years should be reported against that year as data becomes available.,"It is recognised that the quality of data available to estimate the number of people reached with WASH interventions who did not previously have access to the services as defined in the methodology notes will vary. The quality of information on overlap between programmes will also vary. Please indicate any concerns in this respect in the results template and ensure that estimates are conservative where necessary by, for example, excluding overlap between programmes where data is not available on beneficiaries at an individual level (see data calculations section). The JMP of UNICEF/World Health Organisation collates and analyses data on use of water and sanitation facilities from a range of developing countries every 2 years. JMP uses national sources of data and a common indicator definition to estimate progress in the sector. This provides an independent assessment of countryâs own estimates of progress.

No level,,Number of people with sustainable access to an improved sanitation facility through DFID support,DFID (Department for International Development),Look into the primary source if really DFID,"Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)",,"This result is based upon the ânumber of sanitation facilities constructedâ multiplied by the âaverage number of beneficiaries per sanitation facilityâ The bilateral results attributable to DFID will be: (1) DFID-supported programmes that directly result in beneficiaries constructing their own facilities, for example Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing (TSSM) or other Community Approaches to Total Sanitation (CATS)i ; (2) Those people who benefit from direct investment in sanitation facilities in the form of construction or rehabilitation of improvedii sanitation facilities. Facilities constructed under (1) may not meet the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) definition of âimproved sanitationâ but should eliminate open defecation. This is consistent with the sanitation ladder approach adopted under the JMP. Therefore, latrines constructed with DFID support do not need to comply with the JMP definition of an âimprovedâ latrine in order to be counted towards our results, provided that they contribute towards eliminating open defecation in communities. The Country Office may choose to disaggregate results into facilities that meet the JMP definition of âimprovedâ and those that are âunimprovedâ according to the JMP but eliminate open defecation. This will generate a more fine-grained picture of DFIDâs incountry contribution, but this will not affect the results to be reported centrally, which include both categories. This indicator excludes temporary facilities constructed as part of humanitarian interventions. Permanent facilities constructed under humanitarian programmes may be included. The preferred data source for this indicator is programme data on direct beneficiaries and this should capture only individuals who have gained access to sanitation as defined within this methodology which they did not previously have. If alternative data sources are used, care must also be taken to establish the counterfactual - i.e. the number or proportion of people who already had access sanitation according to the definitions outlined in this methodology. This may not always be clear cut. The judgement is whether the level of access has improved from not meeting the definitions within the methodology notes to now meeting the definitions after the intervention. Please make conservative estimates in this respect and contact the WASH policy team if clarification is required. Each individual should be counted only once, even if the same individual benefits from multiple interventions in different years. This indicator refers to sustainability. Measuring sustainability is challenging and would require monitoring well beyond the timespan of the DFID Results Framework. It therefore is not possible to require that all interventions are verified as sustainable. However, sustainability should be considered within project design and monitoring. Note that unlike the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), this indicator measures access rather than use. In this sense, the indicators are generally aligned with other DFID Results Framework indicators which are pitched at output rather than outcome level. Measuring use and attributing the results to DFID would be challenging and potentially more subjective","Lack of sanitation has negative impacts on child health, nutritional outcomes and education..

Sanitation coverage is a key indicator that we would expect to be included in partner countries national statistical record and which would provide the basic data required. The Joint Monitoring Programme of WHO/UNICEF (http://www.wssinfo.org/) publishes a report every 2 years using data on use of improved water supply and basic sanitation from Surveys and censuses.

The JMP does not currently report on hygiene.","We encourage input from offices, particularly on the data challenges. This indicator is an output indicator. It does not capture whether the beneficiaries of programmes go on to use best hygiene practices. This indicator has been preferred to the proxy for handwashing with soap (proportion of households with a designated place to wash hands, in or near the sanitation facility, with a hand cleansing agent (soap or ash) and water available at the time of inspection) This is because of the difficulties of measurement and attribution. It is important to note that mere presence of a facility does not mean that behaviour has changed. What we really want to measure is consistency and frequency of use. But country offices are encouraged to use this proxy indicator to evaluate the reach of their work where available. Indicators of key hygiene practices vary across a broad spectrum but include: -  Handwashing at the 4 critical times; after defecation, after cleaning a baby/child after baby/child's defecation, before preparing food, before feeding a child. -  Observing the safe drinking water chain from protected source to mouth (covering collection, transport (portage), storage and extraction for drinking e.g. ladle, two cup system, and tap. -  Ensuring a safe, clean environment i.e. keeping both human and animal faeces out of the immediate living environment as well as other organic waste which promotes fly breeding with all such waste deposited in rubbish/compost pits at a safe distance from the compound. -  Safe storage of food -  Safe storage of utensils Approaches to measurement/assessment vary depending on a number of factors including the type of intervention and resources available for monitoring. The three standard approaches, in order of increasing difficulty and resource-intensiveness are: 1. Self report (interview or questionnaire survey). Example indicator: % reporting washing hands with soap at critical times (e.g. after defecation). 2. Proxy/inference (e.g. âspot checks"" of facilities, knowledge questions). Example indicator: % households with soap & water present at the designated place for handwashing (DHS survey question 137,138 and 139 or Handwashing Module of MICS survey). 3. Structured observation of behaviour. Example Indicator: % of caregivers observed washing hands with soap at critical times (e.g. before food preparation). At the level of medium to large scale programmes a combination of self-report and proxy measures may be most appropriate but these should be combined with direct observation data from a sample of the target population.

Here, innovations are defined not by their novelty, but by their potential to achieve significant improvements in development outcomes versus existing alternatives. - An innovation can be said to have âthe potential to achieve significant improvements in development outcomes versus existing alternativesâ if a robust theory of change linking the innovation to such outcomes can be articulated. The theory of change should be supported by evidence of the potential benefits of the innovation versus existing alternatives, and it should be tested and refined throughout the development of the innovation to ultimately substantiate this claim (i.e. rigorously demonstrate the innovationâs potential versus existing alternatives).  - Ultimate beneficiaries are host country individuals, especially the socially and economically disadvantaged, who are beneficiaries of USAID assistance and whose participation is essential to achieving sustainable development results. - Support through USG assistance includes human, financial, or institutional resources to support, in full or in part, the discovery, research, development, testing, or implementation of innovations. - STIR stands for the cross-cutting issue area of Science, Technology, Innovation and Research Instructions -  While this indicator is quantitative, operating units are requested to use the narrative boxes for this indicator (in FACTSInfo) to provide examples of the most-promising or highest-performing innovations supported during the reporting period, and the results these innovations have achieved. -  Innovations should be counted only once per annual, PPR reporting period for the life of any award(s) or agreement(s) supporting the innovation.  -  Report the innovation as ânewly supported this periodâ only if the innovation has been supported for the first time in this reporting period (i.e. an innovation ânewâ to USAID).  -  Report the innovation as âongoing support this periodâ if the innovation has ever been reported in a previous period, and the life of award(s) or agreement(s) supporting the innovation are active in the current reporting period.  -  If more than one award or agreement has been made in support of the same innovation in the same reporting period, the innovation should be counted only once (i.e. count number of unique innovations, not number of awards in support of an innovation). Similarly, where an innovation is implemented in multiple geographies within or across countries, the innovation should be counted only once for any and all implementation geographies (i.e. count number of unique innovations, not number of instances of implementation of an innovation). -  If a new award or agreement has been made in support of an innovation during the reporting period, that innovation should be counted only once within the reporting period - as âongoing supportâ - unless the new award or agreement is to support an iteration of the former innovation that is substantially different from the originally-supported innovation.

They include formal sector unions with the right to collectively bargain, public sector worker associations that may or may not have collective bargaining rights, and associations of self-employed workers in the informal sector. Core Labor Standards (CLS), according to the ILO, are defined as fundamental labor rights that should be respected by all member countries regardless of their level of development, including core convetions on: Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize; Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining; Forced Labor; Abolition of Forced Labor; Minimum Age; Worst Forms of Child Labor; Equal Remuneration; Discrimination.","Democratic unions are one of the primary stakeholder groups that are likely to mobilize constituencies and are critical for promoting international labor standards.  As one of the principal membership organizations in many societies, they have the capacity to reach a large number of people in order to advocate for change and influence government and other stakeholders.  If democratically governed, they also can serve as incubators of democratic processes (i.e., free and fair elections) and values (i.e., transparency, accountability, participation, and representation).   Independent trade unions and worker organizations and other groups acting on behalf of worker interests have historically given voice to disenfranchised and vulnerable groups, the very groups that are often excluded from the political system by other institutions.  Given extreme disparities in wealth and power in many developing countries, organizations advocating for worker rights are critical vehicles for promoting interest-based competition in public policy arenas as well as ensuring that the voices of the working poor and marginalized groups are heard.  Women, in particular, have benefitted from having their own representative voice.

The TFA contains 13 articles with a combined total of 41 specific provisions. The maximum number of provisions that could be reported against this indicator would therefore be 41. These include provisions for expediting the movement, release and clearance of goods, including goods in transit. The TFA also sets out measures for effective cooperation between customs and other appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues. The TFA further contains provisions for technical assistance and capacity building in this area.  Refer to this WTO page (https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tradfa_e/tradfa_e.htm) for more information and the full text of the TFA.

The trade corridor should (1) span at least two countries to count for this indicator, and (2) receive USG assistance in the year of reporting. The corridor may cover land or sea, or a combination of both.  To collect data on the cost and days to trade across borders, implementing partners(s)  will need to work with transporters and shippers involved in the trade of targeted value chains to note departure and arrival days and times, and delays at the border(s), whether land, sea, or airports. If a procedure can be accelerated for an additional cost, the fastest legal procedure is chosen. Procedures that can be completed in parallel are measured as simultaneous. The indicator includes the waiting time between procedures, including during unloading of cargo. In the narrative accompanying the indicator in the PPR, the reporting OU should briefly define the trade corridor reported against, and the good(s)/container size selected to calculate the average time. The corridor and good(s) selected for this indicator should remain constant throughout a projectâs or activityâs performance period, i.e. across PPRs, to the extent feasible.

Firms can be formal or informal. If multiple owners, managers or workers in a single firm receive technical assistance over the reporting period, the reporting operating unit should count that as one benefiting firm for the reporting period.  USG funding: For the purpose of this indicator, OUs can count technical assistance that was delivered in full or in part as a result of USG assistance.  This includes delivery of technical assistance made possible through full or partial funding or in-kind support from the USG.  Typically, activities that build export capacity include trade shows, buyer/seller matchmaking programs, market analysis and information, trade finance assistance, and guidance on how to comply with foreign country customs regulations and procedures.  One important component of technical assistance to help nations increase their level of exports is counseling and advice to host-country firms on the steps, procedures, and benefits from trading internationally.

If multiple owners, managers or workers in a single firm receive technical assistance over the reporting period, the reporting operating unit should count that as one benefiting firm for the reporting period.    International quality control institutions: An international quality control institution can be a domestic institution that certifies to international standards.  The most common set of international standards is ISO 9,000.  This quality standard was first introduced in 1987 by the International Organization for Standards (ISO).  Many national quality control institutions have adopted ISO standards. ISO 9000 is used in over 100 countries as a quality assurance standard. These standards specify how management operations should be carried out to insure that domestic suppliers and exporters design, produce, and deliver products and services that meet predetermined standards.  Proven adherence to these standards throughout a value chain assures export customers of the quality and performance an exporter may claim for the goods and services this exporter sells.

Output,EG.3-1,Number of households benefiting directly from USG assistance under Feed the Future,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Economic and Market Development,,"A household is benefiting directly if it contains at least one individual who is a direct beneficiary. An individual is a direct beneficiary if s/he comes into direct contact with the set of interventions (goods or services) provided by the activity. Individuals who receive training or benefit from activity-supported technical assistance or service provision are considered direct beneficiaries, as are those who receive a ration or another type of good.   The intervention in which the individual participates needs to be significant, meaning that if they are only contacted or touched by an activity through brief attendance at a meeting or gathering, that intervention is not significant and s/he should not be counted as a direct beneficiary.  An indirect beneficiary who does not have direct contact with the activity and does not directly receive goods or services from the activity should not be counted even if he/she still benefits. This includes a neighbor who sees the results of an improved technology applied by a direct beneficiary and decides to apply it himself/herself or an individual who hears a radio message but does not receive any other training or counseling from the activity.   This indicator is intended to capture all beneficiary households of Feed the Future (FTF) Activities.  However, care must be taken to eliminate double counting. Households that have more than one direct beneficiary household member should be counted only once.   Households benefiting from FTF interventions in agriculture, nutrition-sensitive agriculture and nutrition can be included under this indicator.

Outcome,EG.3-6,Farmer's gross margin per hectare obtained with USG assistance,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Economic and Market Development,,"The gross margin is the difference between the total value of small-holder production of an agricultural commodity (crop, fish) and the cost of producing that commodity, divided by the total number of units in production (hectares of crops, pond area in hectares for pond aquaculture).  Gross margin per hectare is a measure of net income from that farm/fisheries activity.     Gross margin is calculated automatically by FTFMS from the following data points, reported as totals across all direct beneficiaries, and disaggregated by commodity and by sex:   1. Total Production (kg, mt, number, or other unit of measure ) by direct beneficiaries during the reporting period (TP);  2. Total Value of Sales (USD) by direct beneficiaries during the reporting period (VS); 3. Total Quantity of Sales (kg, mt, number, or other unit of measure) by direct beneficiaries during the reporting period (QS);  4. Total Recurrent Cash Input Costs (USD) of direct beneficiaries during the reporting period (IC);  5. Total Units of Production: Area  planted in ha (for crops); Area in ha (for aquaculture ponds) for direct beneficiaries during the production period (UP). Gross margin per ha = [(TP x VS/QS) - IC ] / UP.  The unit of measure for Total Production (kg, mt, liter, number) must be the same as the unit of measure for Total Quantity of Sales, so that the average unit value calculated by dividing sales value by sales quantity can be used to value total production (TP x VS/QS).   If sales quantity are recorded in a different unit of measure from what is used for production, they must be converted into the equivalent in the units of measure used for total production prior to entry in FTFMS.  For example, if Total Production was measured in metric tons, and Total Quantity of Sales was measured in kg, Total Quantity of Sales should be divided by 1,000 before being entered in FTFMS.  If the form of the commodity varies between how it was harvested or produced and how it was sold, e.g. unshelled peanuts are harvested but shelled peanuts are sold, the sales form must be converted to its equivalent in the harvested/produced form prior to entry in FTFMS.  For example, in Malawi, the extraction rate for shelled from unshelled peanuts is 65%. So if 1,500 kg of shelled peanuts were sold, this is equivalent to 2,304 kg of unshelled peanuts, and 2,304 should be entered as sales quantity, not 1,500, assuming that total production was measured in kg of unshelled peanuts.

(Note, it is not necessary to calculate the actual percent contribution of each input to total input costs to determine which inputs account for at least 5% of total costs.  Partners should be able to guess-estimate which inputs qualify.)  The most common cash input cost items are:  purchased water, fuel, electricity, seeds, fish meal, fertilizer, pesticides, hired labor, hired enforcement, and hired equipment services.  Capital investments and depreciation should not be included in cash costs.  Unpaid family labor, seeds from a previous harvest and other in-kind inputs should not be included in Total Recurrent Cash Input Costs.  Partners should enter disaggregated values of the five gross margin data points, disaggregated first by commodity, then by the sex disaggregate category: male, female, joint and association-applied, as applicable. Commodity-sex layered disaggregated data are required because the most meaningful interpretation and use of gross margin information is at the specific commodity level, including the comparison of gross margins obtained by female and male farmers.  FTFMS will then use the formula above to automatically calculate the average commodity-specific gross margin, and the average commodity-specific gross margin for each sex disaggregate.  For example, for the total production data point, partners should enter total production during the reporting year on plots managed by female, maize-producing, direct beneficiaries; total production on plots managed by male, maize-producing, direct beneficiaries; total production during the reporting year on plots managed jointly by female and male, maize-producing, direct beneficiaries, if applicable; and total production on plots managed by groups (âassociation-appliedâ), maize-producing, direct beneficiaries, if applicable.  And so forth for the other data points: total value of sales; total quantity of sales; total cash recurrent input costs; and total units of production - hectares in this case. The same procedure applies for each commodity. The FTFMS will automatically calculate weighted (by total hectares, animals, or cages) average gross margin, in USD  per ha, animal, or cage for the overall commodity (e.g. gross margin/hectare for maize among all direct beneficiaries) and for each sex disaggregate category (e.g. gross margin/hectare for female maize-producing direct beneficiaries.)   In addition to the five data points, partners must enter the number of direct beneficiaries of the activity, disaggregated by commodity and then sex.  A direct beneficiary should be counted only once under each commodity regardless of the number of production cycles for the commodity during the reporting year. If a plot of land falls under the disaggregate âjointly-managedâ, the number of beneficiaries jointly managing the plot should be counted.  In the case of the âassociation-appliedâ disaggregate however, neither the association nor the individuals involved in the association can be considered as a direct beneficiary and therefore nothing should be counted.   If a direct beneficiary sample survey is used to collect gross margin data points, the sample weighted estimate of the total across all beneficiaries must be calculated for each data point using appropriate sample weights before being  entered into FTFMS to ensure accurate calculation of weighted average gross margin per commodity across all implementing mechanisms at the Operating Unit level as well as across all Feed the Future countries for global reporting. If there is more than one production cycles in the reporting year, all data points should be summed across production cycles if the same commodity was produced, including farmerâs land area, which should be counted (and summed) each time it is cultivated.   If the production cycle from soil preparation/planting to sales starts in one fiscal year and ends in another, gross margin should be reported in the second fiscal year, once all data points are available. In these cases, since the four key agricultural indicators (gross margins, number of farmers applying improved technologies, number of hectares under improved technologies, and incremental sales) are all related, all four indicators should be reported in the second fiscal year.   Gross margin targets should be entered at the commodity level. Targets do not need to be set for each of the five data points or at the sex disaggregate level.  Note that the FTFMS will automatically generates the PPR gross margin per unit of land indicator by calculating, at the operating unit level, a weighted average gross margin per hectare (includes crops and pond-based aquaculture) across all relevant commodities reported by Implementing Partners.  This PPR indicator can be then entered into FactsInfo.  Caution should be exercised when interpreting this PPR indicator, however, because this gross margin is not commodity-specific and may be calculated across substantially different commodities (e.g. average gross margin for maize and for basil, or for irrigated and for rain-fed rice).  These average gross margins could be meaningless or misleading.  Missions are encouraged to use the FTFMS commodity- and sex-specific data to analyze and report on gross margins.",

In the case of the âassociation-appliedâ disaggregate however, neither the association nor the individuals involved in the association can be considered as a direct beneficiary and therefore nothing should be counted.  If a direct beneficiary sample survey is used to collect gross margin data points, the sample weighted estimate of the total across all beneficiaries must be calculated for each data point using appropriate sample weights before being  entered into FTFMS to ensure accurate calculation of weighted average gross margin per commodity across all implementing mechanisms at the Operating Unit level as well as across all Feed the Future countries for global reporting. If there is more than one production cycle in the reporting year, all data points should be summed across production cycles if the same commodity was produced, including number of cages, which should be counted (and summed) each time they are used.   If the production cycle from fingerlings to sales starts in one fiscal year and ends in another, gross margin should be reported in the second fiscal year, once all data points are available. In these cases, since the three key agricultural indicators (gross margins, number of farmers applying improved technologies, and incremental sales - number of hectares under improved technologies is not applicable to open-water aquaculture activities) are all related, all three indicators should be reported in the second fiscal year.   Gross margin targets should be entered at the commodity level. Targets do not need to be set for each of the five data points or at the sex disaggregate level.  Note that the FTFMS will automatically generate the PPR gross margin indicator by calculating, at the operating unit level, a weighted average gross margin per cage across all relevant commodities reported by Implementing Partners.  This PPR indicator can then be entered into FactsInfo.  Caution should be exercised when interpreting the PPR indicators, however, because this average gross margin is not commodity-specific and may be calculated across substantially different commodities (e.g. average gross margin for fish and for shrimp).  This average gross margin could be meaningless or misleading.  Missions are encouraged to use the FTFMS commodity- and sex-specific data to analyze and report on gross margins. ",
Outcome,EG.3-9,Number of full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs created with USG assistance ,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Economic and Market Development,,This indicator counts all types of employment held during the reporting year in agriculture or rural-related enterprises (including paid on-farm/fishery employment) that were created with USG assistance. It counts existing jobs that were created in the current or in previous reporting years.  Jobs lasting less than one month (or less than 20 days excluding weekends) are not counted in order to emphasize those jobs that provide more stability through length.   Jobs should be converted to full-time equivalents (FTE).  One FTE equals 260 days (excluding weekends) or 12 months.  Thus a job that lasts 4 months should be counted as 1/3 FTE and a job that lasts for 130 days (excluding weekends) should be counted as 1/2 FTE.  Number of hours worked per day or per week is not restricted as work hours may vary greatly. âWith USG assistanceâ includes farm and non-farm jobs where Feed the Future investments are intentional in assisting in any way to expand employment and where an objective of the Feed the Future activity is job creation.,"This is a direct measure of improved livelihoods, as it measures creation of employment and related income.

This can include secondary rights.   âFormalizedâ here implies that the user of the rural land, farm land, fishery, or water body has some type of formal administrative recognition of property or user rights that increases the tenure security of the resource for the owner/user.  The formalization process varies by activity but can include the recordation or registration of a customary or informal right, as well as the regularization or adjudication of rights prior to formalization. ","Although it is not the only approach, registration of farmland or fishing area increases the security of tenure over the land or fish stocks. This in turn increases the security of durable capital investments in the land that can have significant positive impact on agricultural productivity.

There is no pre-defined minimum or maximum length of time for the training; what is key is that the training reflects a planned, structured curriculum designed to strengthen capacities, and there is a reasonable expectation that the training recipient will acquire new knowledge or skills that s/he could translate into action.  However, Operating Units may choose to align their definition of short-term training with the TrainNet training definition of 2 consecutive class days or more in duration, or 16 hours or more scheduled intermittently.   Count an individual only once, regardless of the number of trainings received during the reporting year and even if the trainings covered different topics. Do not count sensitization meetings or one-off informational trainings.  In-country and off-shore training are included.

The loan can be from a formal or informal financial institution, including a micro-finance institution (MFI), commercial bank, or informal lender, or from an in-kind lender of equipment (e.g. tractor, plow), agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilizer or seeds), or transport, with repayment in cash or in kind. USG assistance may include partial loan guarantee programs or any support facilitating the receipt of a loan..  Number of employees refers to full time-equivalent workers during the reporting year. MSMEs include producers (farmers). Producers should be classified as micro, small or medium-enterprise based on the number of FTE workers hired (permanent and/or seasonal) during the previous 12 months. If a producer does not hire any permanent or seasonal labor, s/he should be considered a micro-enterprise.

Output,EG.3.2-5,Number of public-private partnerships formed as a result of USG assistance,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Economic and Market Development,,"This indicator counts the number of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in agriculture or nutrition formed during the reporting year due to a Feed the Future intervention (i.e. agricultural or nutrition activity, as described below).    A public-private partnership is considered formed when there is a clear agreement, usually written, between two or more formal entities to work together to achieve a common objective.  There must be either a cash or in-kind significant contribution to the effort by both the public and the private entity or entities.   The essential characteristics of a PPP are:  1. The objective of the partnership agreement between the public and private entity(ies) is to achieve a common good,  2. The private sector partner's contribution to the PPP goes beyond the private sector partner's immediate commercial interests,  3. The public contribution is leveraging private resources that the private entity would not otherwise be contributing.    To count as a PPP, the private entity must spend or contribute something that is additional, or above and beyond what it would normally spend/contribute as a usual cost of doing business.  Do not count as a PPP an agreement that involves the private entity simply attending to its day-to-day business needs (e.g., a processor purchasing produce). Do not count as a private sector contribution to a PPP purchase agreements between a firm and project's beneficiaries, investments made by a firm in its own operations, or loans made under a USAID loan guarantee.  A public entity can be the national or a sub-national government as well as a donor-funded  implementing partner. USAID must be one of the public partners. USAID is almost always represented in the partnership by its implementing partner. For-profit enterprises and NGOs are considered private. It includes state enterprises that are non-profit. A state-owned enterprise which seeks to make a profit (even if unsuccessfully) is counted as a private entity.   An agricultural activity is any activity related to s rengthening the supply of agricultural inputs, application of production methods, agricultural processing, marketing or transportation.  A nutritional activity includes any activity focused on improving the nutritional content of agricultural products as provided to consumers, developing improved nutritional products, increasing support for nutrition service delivery, etc.    PPPs can be long or short in duration (length is not a criteria for measurement).   A mission or an activity may form more than one partnership with the same entity, but this is likely to be rare.  Count both Global Development Alliance (GDA) partnerships and non-GDA partnerships.   Count only public-private partnerships formed during the current reporting year. Any partnership that was formed in a previous year should not be included.  Do not count the number of transactions, only the number of partnerships formed during the reporting year.  Partnerships that include multiple partners should only be counted once.  ",Feed the Future (FTF) pursues PPPs to leverage additional resources toward our public good goals.

It is not required that a technology pass through all three phases to be reported under the indicator. For example, a seed variety that is only being field-tested for country-level adaptation and then submitted for country-level certification would only be tracked through phases II and III.  â¦in Phase I:  under research as a result of USG assistance: Count new technologies or management practices under research in the current reporting year. Any new technology or management practice that was under research in a previous year but not during the reporting year should not be included. Technologies under research are as follows:  a. For biotech crop research: When technologies are under research, the process is contained in a laboratory or greenhouse; once the possibility of success is judged high enough, a permit is required to move to field testing.  The change of location from a contained laboratory or greenhouse to a confined field with the receipt of a permit indicate that the research has completed the âunder researchâ stage.  b. For non-biotech crop research: When technologies are under research, plant breeders work on developing new lines on research plots under controlled conditions. All research should have a target, often expressed in terms of traits to be combined into a specific cultivar or breed. When the research achieves âproof of conceptâ (by accumulating technical information and test results that indicate that the target is achievable), the âunder researchâ phase is completed.  Note that for crops, much or all of this phase might be conducted outdoors and in soil; these attributes do not make this work âfield testing.â c. For non-crop research: âunder researchâ signifies similarly research conducted under ideal conditions to develop or support the development of the product or process.  â¦in Phase II:  under field testing as a result of USG assistance: âUnder field testingâ means that research has moved from focused development to broader testing under conditions intended to resemble those that the potential users of the new technology will encounter. Testing might be done in the actual facilities or fields of potential users, or it might be in a facility set up to duplicate those conditions. More specifically:  a. For biotech crop research: Once a permit has been obtained and the research moves to a confined field, the research is said to be âunder field testing.â  b. For non-biotech crop or fisheries research: During âfield testingâ the development of the product or technology continues under end-user conditions in multi-location trails, which might be conducted at a research station or on farmersâ/producerâs fields/waters or both.  Note that for crops, all of this phase would be conducted outdoors and in soil, but this is not what makes this work âfield testing.â  c. For non-crop research: âunder field testingâ signifies similarly research conducted under user conditions to further test the product, process, or practice.  In the case of research to improve equipment, the endpoint of field testing could be sales of equipment (when the tester is a commercial entity). In other cases it could be distribution of designs (when the tester is a non-commercial entity) or the distribution of publications or other information (based on the results of field testing).  â¦in Phase III:  made available for transfer as a result of USG assistance. This phase counts technologies that are now able to be transferred to an end user. It does not count the number of technologies actually transferred by public or private entities, including implementing partners.  Completing a research activity does not in itself constitute having made a technology available for transfer. Conditions may need to be met before a technology can move into the public domain, and this Phase captures technologies that have met these conditions.  For example, in the case of crop research that developed a new variety, the variety has to pass through any required approval and certification process, and seed of the new variety should be available for multiplication in order for the seed to be available to public or private entities which can then transfer to the end user.  Technologies made available for transfer should be only those made available in the current reporting year. Any technology made available for transfer in a previous year should not be included. In some cases more than one operating unit may count the same technology. This would occur if the technology were developed, for instance, in collaboration with a U.S. university and passed through regional collaboration to other countries. ",

Examples for listed technology type disaggregates include:  - Crop Genetics: e.g. improved/certified seed that could be higher-yielding, higher in nutritional content (e.g. through bio-fortification, such as vitamin A-rich sweet potatoes or rice, or high-protein maize, or drought tolerant maize, or stress tolerant rice) and/or more resilient to climate impacts; improved germplasm.  - Cultural Practices: e.g. seedling production and transplantation; cultivation practices such as planting density and moulding; mulching.  - Livestock Management: e.g. improved livestock breeds; livestock health services and products such as vaccines; improved livestock handling practices.  - Wild Fishing Technique/Gear: e.g. sustainable fishing practices; improved nets, hooks, lines, traps, dredges, trawls; improved hand gathering, netting, angling, spearfishing, and trapping practices.  - Aquaculture Management: e.g. improved fingerlings; improved feed and feeding practices; fish disease control; pond culture; pond preparation; sampling & harvesting; carrying capacity & fingerling management.  - Pest Management: e.g. Integrated Pest Management; improved insecticides and pesticides; improved and environmentally sustainable use of insecticides and pesticides.  - Disease Management: e.g. improved fungicides; appropriate application of fungicides.  - Soil-related Fertility and Conservation: e.g. Integrated Soil Fertility Management; soil management practices that increase biotic activity and soil organic matter levels, such as soil amendments that increase fertilizer-use efficiency (e.g. soil organic matter, mulching); improved fertilizer; improved fertilizer use practices; erosion control. - Irrigation: e.g. drip, surface, and sprinkler irrigation; irrigation schemes.  - Water Management - non-irrigation-based: e.g. water harvesting; sustainable water use practices; improved water quality testing practices; mulching.  - Climate Mitigation: technologies selected because they minimize emission intensities relative to other alternatives.  Examples include low- or no-till practices, efficient nitrogen fertilizer use. -Climate Adaptation: technologies promoted with the explicit objective of adapting to current climate change concerns.

Note there is some overlap between the disaggregates listed here and those listed under EG.3.2-18 Number of hectares of land under improved technologies or management practices as a result of USG assistance.  This overlap is limited to technologies and practices that relate to activities focused on land.  The list of disaggregates here is much broader because with this indicator we aim at tracking efforts focused on individuals (as opposed to land area) across the value chain in both land and non-land based activities.  If an activity is promoting a technology for multiple- benefits, the beneficiary applying the technology may be reported under each relevant Technology Type category. For example, mulching could be reported under Cultural practices (weed control), Soil-related fertility and conservation (organic content) and Water management (moisture control), depending on how (for what purpose(s)/benefit(s)) the activity is promoted it to the beneficiary farmers. If a beneficiary applied more than one improved technology during the reporting year, count the beneficiary under each technology type (i.e. double-count) ) and under each commodity to which s/he applied an improved technology.  However, count the beneficiary only once in the applicable Sex disaggregate category.   If more than one beneficiary in a household is applying improved technologies, count each beneficiary in the household who does so.  Since it is very common for Feed the Future activities to promote more than one improved technology, not all of which are applied by all beneficiaries at once, this approach allows Feed the Future to accurately track and count the uptake of different technology types, and to accurately count the total number of farmers applying improved technologies.   See EG.3.2-18 for an example of how to double-count hectares and farmers.  If a beneficiary cultivates a plot of land more than once during the reporting year, count the beneficiary once under each type of technology that was applied during any of the production cycles, but not more than once even if a technology is applied in multiple production cycles during the reporting year.  For example, because of new access to irrigation as a result of a Feed the Future activity, a farmer can now cultivate a second crop during the dry season in addition to her/his regular crop during the rainy season.  Whether the farmer applies Feed the Future promoted improved seed to her/his plot during one season and not the other, or in both the rainy and dry season, s/he would only be counted once in the Crop Genetics category under the Technology Type disaggregate. Note however that the area planted with improved seed should be counted each time it is cultivated under the indicator EG.3-6 Gross margin per unit of land and indicator EG.3.2-18 Number of hectares of land under improved technologies.  Beneficiaries who are part of a group that apply improved technologies on a demonstration or other common plot, are not counted as having individually applied an improved technology.  Instead, the group should be counted as one (1) beneficiary group and reported under indicator EG.3.2-20 Number of private enterprises, producers organizationsâ¦ and community-based organizations (CBOs) that applied improved technologies.  The area of the communal plot should be counted under indicator EG.3-6 Gross margin per unit of land and indicator EG.3.2-18 Number of hectares of land under improved technologies.  If a lead farmer cultivates a plot used for training, e.g., a demonstration plot used for Farmer Field Days or Farmer Field School, the lead farmer should be counted as a beneficiary for this indicator.  In addition, the area of the demonstration plot should be counted under indicator EG.3-6 Gross margin per unit of land, if applicable  and indicator EG.3.2-18 Number of hectares of land under improved technologies.  However, if the demonstration or training plot is cultivated by extension agents or researchers (a demonstration plot in a research institute, for instance), neither the area nor the extension agent or researcher should be counted under this indicator, EG.3-6, or EG.3.2-18.  This indicator counts individuals who applied improved technologies, whereas indicator EG.3.2-20 Number of private enterprises, producers organizationsâ¦and community-based organizations (CBOs) that applied improved technologies or management practices counts firms, associations, or other group entities that applied improved organization-level technologies or practices.  However, in most cases, this indicator should not count as individuals members of an organization that applied a technology or practice.  For example, if a producer association implements a new computer-based accounting system during the reporting year, the association would be counted under indicator 4.5.2(42) Number of private enterprises, producers organizationsâ¦applying indicator, but the members of the producer association would not be counted as having individually-applied an improved technology/practice under this indicator.  However, there are some cases where both the group entity should be counted under indicator EG.3.2-20 and its members counted under this indicator. For example, a producer association purchases a dryer and then provides drying services for a fee to its members. In this scenario, the producer association can be counted under EG.3.2-20 and any association member that uses the dryer service can be counted as applying an improved technology/practice under this indicator.  If a direct beneficiary sample survey is used to collect data for this indicator, the sample weighted estimate of the total number of beneficiaries for each Technology Type and Sex disaggregate must be calculated using appropriate sample weights before being  entered into FTFMS to ensure accurate calculation of weighted averages across all implementing mechanisms at the Operating Unit level as well as across all Feed the Future countries for global reporting.A3",

Outcome,EG.3.2-19,Value of smallholder incremental sales generated with USG assistance,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Economic and Market Development,,"This indicator collects both volume (in metric tons ) and value (in US dollars) of sales of targeted commodities from small-holder direct beneficiaries for its calculation.  This includes all sales by the small-holder direct beneficiaries of the targeted commodity(ies), not just farm-gate sales.  Only count sales in the reporting year that are attributable to the Feed the Future investment, i.e. where Feed the Future assisted the individual farmer directly.  Examples of Feed the Future assistance include facilitating access to improved seeds, other inputs, extension services, markets and other activities that benefited small-holders.  The value of incremental sales measures the value (in USD) of the total amount of targeted agricultural products sold by small-holder direct beneficiaries relative to a base year and is calculated as the total value of sales of a product (crop, animal, or fish) during the reporting year minus the total value of sales in the base year.   The number of direct beneficiaries of Feed the Future activities often increases over time as the activity rolls-out. Unless an activity has identified all prospective direct beneficiaries at the time the baseline is established, the baseline sales value will only include sales made by beneficiaries identified when the baseline is established during the first year of implementation. The baseline sales value will not include the âbaselineâ sales made prior to their involvement in the Feed the Future activity by beneficiaries added in subsequent years.  Thus the baseline sales value will underestimate total baseline sales of all beneficiaries, and consequently overestimate incremental sales for reporting years when the beneficiary base has increased.  To address this issue, Feed the Future requires reporting the number of direct beneficiaries for each value chain commodity along with baseline and reporting year sales. FTFMS uses the baseline sales and baseline number of beneficiaries to establish average sales per beneficiary at baseline. The average sales per beneficiary are multiplied by the number of beneficiaries in each reporting year to create an adjusted baseline sales value.  To accurately estimate out-year targets for incremental sales, targets for number of beneficiaries are also required.  It is absolutely essential that a Baseline Year Sales data point be entered. The Value of Incremental Sales indicator value cannot be calculated without a value for Baseline Year Sales. If data on the total value of sales of the value chain commodity by direct beneficiaries prior to Feed the Future activity implementation started is not available, do not leave the baseline blank or enter â0â. Use the earliest Reporting Year Sales actual as the Baseline Year Sales.  This will cause some underestimation of the total value of incremental sales achieved by the Feed the Future activity, but this is preferable to being unable to calculate incremental sales at all.  If a direct beneficiary sample survey is used to collect data for this indicator, the sample weighted estimate of total baseline or reporting year sales value and volume for all small-holder beneficiaries under each commodity must be calculated using appropriate sample weights before being  entered into FTFMS to ensure accurate calculation of weighted averages across all implementing mechanisms at the Operating Unit level as well as across all Feed the Future countries for global reporting.

Data should be collected annually at the same time of year since the indicator will likely display considerable seasonal variability.  If possible, data should be collected at the time of year when diversity is likely to be the lowest to best capture improvements in year-round consumption of a diverse diet. However, Feed the Future recognizes that data for this indicator is likely to be collected in the post-harvest/sale period when data for other Required if Applicable (RiA) indicators, such as gross margins and incremental sales, are collected.  In this case, the indicator value may reflect a best-case scenario in terms of yearly access to a quality and diverse diet by female beneficiaries.  Notes:  1. This indicator complements the Feed the Future indicator âPrevalence of women of reproductive age consuming a diet of minimum diversity,â which measures minimum dietary diversity among women 15-49 years old in the Feed the Future Zone of Influence through a population-based survey. 2.

Outcome,EG.3.3-11,Total quantity of targeted nutrient-rich value chain commodities produced by direct beneficiaries with USG assistance that is set aside for home consumption ,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Economic and Market Development,,"This is a beneficiary-based outcome indicator for nutrition-sensitive agricultural value chain activities that aim in part to improve nutrition through increased consumption among direct beneficiary households of a nutrient-rich value chain commodity they produce (i.e. the âown production to food consumptionâ agriculture to nutrition pathway.)  This indicator measures how much of the total production of a nutrient-rich value chain commodity targeted by a USG-funded activity is set aside for consumption by household members.   An agricultural value chain activity influences the structure, systems, and relationships that define the full range of activities â from input supply to production to processing and final marketing â required to bring an agricultural commodity (crop, livestock, fish) from its conception to its end use.  It helps value chain actors improve their productivity and thereby contribute to and benefit from the value chainâs growth and competitiveness.   A nutrition-sensitive agricultural value chain activity has explicit consumption, diet quality, or other nutrition-related objectives and/or outcomes.   A direct beneficiary producer has direct contact with the interventions (e.g. training, technical assistance, input access) provided by the value chain activity.  The contact needs to be significant, meaning, for example, that a producer touched by the value chain activity through brief attendance at a meeting or gathering should not be counted as a direct beneficiary producer.  âSet-asideâ for home consumption includes any amount of the targeted product already consumed by direct beneficiary households at the time of data collection, and any amount in storage for the purpose of future home consumption. The amounts already consumed versus in storage for future consumption will vary depending on the commodity (length of harvest season, perishability) and time of data collection.   To be included in this indicator, a commodity must meet three criteria:","Multiple pathways exist to increase household and individual access to and consumption of diverse and quality foods (Feed the Future Results Framework Intermediate Result 6) and thus improve nutrition within the Zone of Influence). One of these pathways is the âown production to food consumptionâ pathway, which is a direct pathway to increased consumption via increased household production of the targeted value chain nutrient-rich commodity.  This indicator allows missions and partners to monitor one step in the ""production pathway"" - whether beneficiaries consumed or intended to consume some of what they produced. It complements the Feed the Future population-based indicators that capture actual consumption of targeted nutrient-rich commodities among the women of reproductive age and children 6-23 months in the zone of influence (ZOI) from all sources (e.g. own-production, purchase.) However, it is important to note that a nutrient-rich commodity will not contribute to improved micronutrient status if there are no deficiencies in any of the specific micronutrients provided by the commodity. Additional information on factors that may influence home consumption of produced commodities, potential limitations of this indicator, and important considerations for designing effective nutrition-sensitive value chain activities is in the Feed the Future Handbook of Indicator Definitions Appendix 3: Questions and answers on the new nutrition-sensitive agriculture indicators.",Number (Metric Tons),,"In FTFMS: Commodity  In FACTSInfo: Commodity group: Bio-fortified, Legume, nut or seed, Animal-sourced food, Dark yellow or orange-fleshed root or tuber, âHigh sourceâ fruit or vegetable",,,,,"Data come from direct beneficiary farmer/fisher/rancher sample Surveys; data collection through producer organizations or farm records; or routine activity records. In most cases, data for this indicator are collected at the same time and using the same data source as data for the total production data point for the EG3.2-6,7,8 Gross Margin indicator.",,,Annual ,,,,,This indicator will be used to report progress under USAIDâs Multisectoral Nutrition Strategy and in the Feed the Future Progress Report.,,,,,,,,EG3.3,,"First, a USG-funded value chain activity must be promoting improved production of the commodity. These value chain activities may include social and behavior change components, but commodities being promoted solely through social and behavior change interventions should not be counted under this indicator.  Also, this indicator is not appropriate for non-value chain home or community garden or for sustainable intensification agriculture interventions aiming to increase the diversity of products produced by the household, in whole or in part for household consumption.   Second, the value chain commodity must have been selected for nutrition objectives, in addition to any poverty- reduction or economic- growth related objectives.  Third, the commodity must be nutrient-rich.  A commodity is defined as nutrient-rich if it meets any of the following criteria: 1. Is bio-fortified 2. Is a legume, nut, or seed 3. Is an animal-sourced food including dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese), eggs, organ meat, flesh foods, and other miscellaneous small animal protein (e.g. grubs, insects) 4. Is a dark or orange-fleshed root or tuber 5. Is a fruit or vegetable that meets the threshold for being a ""high source"" of one or more micronutrients per 100 gram basis A useful of list of commodities under criteria 2 through 4 may be found in the WHO document: Indicators for assessing infant and young child feeding practices, Part 2, Measurement [1].  The micronutrients considered under criterion 5 are those often lacking in the diets of women of reproductive age [2] and children under two [3] in developing countries. These micronutrients are vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folate, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and zinc [4]; or any other micronutrient for which a documented deficiency exists within the target population. The Codex Alimentarias Guidelines provide thresholds for considering a food as a a âhigh sourceâ of different nutrients, based on the percent of the Nutrient Reference Value (NRV) provided by the food.  A food must provide 30% of NRV per 100 grams, to be considered a âhigh sourceâ of the nutrient.  http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599290_eng.pdf Based on these defined thresholds, value chain horticultural commodities currently promoted by Feed the Future that meet criterion 5 include: cabbage, mangos, okra, passion-fruit, pineapple and sweet green pepper.  Value chain commodities currently promoted that do not meet criterion 5 include: banana, cucumber, eggplant, green beans, onion, shallot, and tomato.  An Operating Unit working with a horticultural value chain commodity not listed here that meets the value chain activity definition outlined above but is unsure whether the commodity meets the defined threshold under criterion 5, should consult the Feed the Future Handbook of Indicator Definitions Appendix 3, âQuestions and answers on the new nutrition-sensitive agriculture indicatorsâ.  This appendix provides information on thresholds for specific micronutrients as well as where to find nutrient composition information for value chain commodities.  An operating unit should contact its BFS M&E Technical Advisor if it needs assistance in determining if a value chain commodity meets the criteria for inclusion in this indicator. Data on quantity must be entered into the Feed the Future Monitoring System (FTFMS) commodity by commodity.  The unit of measure of quantity (e.g. kg, liter) and the number of direct beneficiary producers must be entered, by commodity.  The unit of measure will be used to convert quantities to metric tons.  The number of direct beneficiaries and average household size in the Feed the Future Zone of Influence (or in the rural population overall in non-focus countries) will be used by Feed the Future to estimate per capita values. FTFMS will produce a PPR report that provides the indicator data converted to metric tons and aggregated to the overall indicator value and the commodity group disaggregates values for entry into FACTSInfo.

Outcome,EG.7.1-1,Number of beneficiaries with improved energy services due to USG assistance,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Economic and Market Development,,"This is the number of people who benefit from improved energy services due to USAID assistance.  Illustrative examples of improved energy service include a new electricity connection, improved cook stove, or access to gas, increased number of hours of electricity service, and reduced outages and voltage fluctuations.  The main limitations of this indicator include estimating the number of beneficiaries of energy services for public facilities (schools, health clinics, etc.). This indicator must be counted by USAID Operating Unit contractors and grantees on an annual basis.  Each contractor and grantee will be asked to identify the infrastructure or service that has been supported with USAID funding, and to estimate using reasonable methods the number of beneficiaries. This indicator can be extrapolated from the average number of persons per household, which will vary by country.  Beneficiaries may be counted each time they receive an improved energy service. This indicator includes disaggregates for whether the improved energy service is from clean energy or non-clean energy sources, and for the sex of the beneficiaries. According to Sec. 7069 of the FY 2012 Congressional Appropriations Act and accompanying Statement of Managers, clean energy is defined as renewable energy technologies and end-use energy efficiency technologies. It follows that clean energy does not include nuclear power, gas, coal and oil production, transmission, distribution, direct use; the generation of electricity with these fuels; or supply-side energy efficiency technologies. In limited cases, with GCC Coordinator approval, avoided gas flaring may be allowed under this definition.",The number of beneficiaries of USAID- assisted energy services indicates increased availability of energy for more rapid and sustained economic growth and social development.,Persons (quantitative - number),,"Sex of clean energy, sex of non-clean energy",,,,,Data will be collected by implementing partners with knowledge of their specific activities and programs.,,,Annual ,,,,,This indicator will enable the Agency to explain to external stakeholders how many persons globally benefit from energy services supported by USAID.,,,,,,,,Economic Growth (EG) 7.1: Expanded Access to Modern Energy Services,,,

(e.g., officially proposed, adopted, or implemented?), How does the measure contribute to advancing biodiversity conservation and/or other environmental themes?, and What is/are the institution(s) that will be implementing and/or enforcing the measure, and at what scale (e.g., national, state, municipal, community)?  Some known data limitations when using this standard Indicator; (a) Validity - If the intended result is an improved enabling environment, then the numbers of laws, policies, and regulations provides only a partial measure of success, given that effective implementation and enforcement are also critical. Laws, policies, and regulations may also not be well-designed or effective. Different scale strategies and plans have different scopes of impact. Narrative is critical for interpreting this indicator. (b) Timeliness - Preparatory studies and stakeholder relationship building may be required prior to proposal, adoption, or implementation of the measure. (c) Precision - This indicator does not capture progress made along the way in terms of convening stakeholders, gathering and disseminating scientific evidence, fomenting inter-sector collaboration, and evaluating enforcement.

It may include community members without law enforcement authority that support law enforcement actions as patrol participants. Examples of individuals receiving USG assistance that may count towards this indicator include but are not restricted to: police, park rangers, district prosecutors, customs agents, and members of a community patrol unit. Improved conservation law enforcement practices include procedures, analyses, technologies, intelligence systems, or other means by which enforcement of laws that conserve biodiversity is expected or demonstrated to be more effective and/or efficient than the status quo.  Practices include those intended to:  better deter, detect or disrupt environmental crime; improve the quality, quantity or use of crime scene evidence; increase the frequency of arrest and prosecution; and increase the likelihood that penalties (fines or jail sentences) are appropriately severe and served in full.  The number of people carrying out improved practices to reduce underlying consumer demand for illegally or unsustainably obtained natural resources should NOT be reported here. Verifying that improved practices are applied can be challenging.  Official records and implementer observations are the best means of verification. Interview or survey instruments applied to law enforcement unit managers or community leaders may also be applied.  Indicator targets and reporting should be based on the cumulative number of people that apply improved conservation law enforcement practices as a result of USG assistance during each fiscal year of performance reporting, regardless of when during the project cycle the assistance was provided.  For example, if 30 people were trained in year 1, and 20 of them were documented as applying improved practices in year 1, report â20.â  In year 2, if those 20 still apply improved practices, and another 20 were trained in and all documented as applying improved practices in year 2, report â40â (=ongoing Year 1 + additional Year 2).

This indicator measures the percent of these adults who: (i) report awareness of the entity, office, or related facility; (ii) can identify one or more services offered by the entity, office, or related facility; and (iii) report valuing the services offered by the entity, office, or related facility (even if they themselves have not utilized the offered services). Interventions that include both technical and physical components should be counted only once. Any entity can be counted once in the year the upgrade/establishment occurs.

Output,EG.11-5,Number of people supported by the USG to adapt to the effects of climate change,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Economic and Market Development,,"âSupportâ is defined as assistance from the project or activity, with the intention of helping people adapt to climate change. Support encompasses financial resources, assets, infrastructure, agricultural inputs, training, communications (e.g. early warning systems) or information (e.g. weather forecasting). People reported under this indicator may also be reported under other standard indicators, as appropriate. Reporting under this indicator requires the effects of climate change to be recognized and targeted by the project or activity. âPeople supportedâ relates to populations with a clear relationship to an adaptation project or activity. If the data collected is by household then this figure should be converted into the number of people (see Data calculation section below). âEffects of climate changeâ are defined here as the effects of increasing climate variability and climate change. This may include changes to precipitation, temperature and sea level rise. Effects may occur suddenly or gradually, and can include floods, droughts, storms, landslides, salinization, coastal inundation, sea level rise, desertification, heat or cold waves and biodiversity loss, among other effects. This indicator seeks to measure the number of people who have received support as a proxy for preparing and equipping them, but does not seek to determine whether this support reduced the impacts of climate change on the reported population. These outcomes will be sought through other methods, where possible. Varying levels of support may count under this indicator. Targeted support where individual people or households are identified and aware they are receiving support in some form should be included. Reporting should include people receiving high levels of individualized support (including, but not limited to agricultural extension services and training of individuals in communities to develop emergency plans) as well as people receiving medium levels of support (including, but not limited to people receiving information services such as a flood warning or weather forecast by text, people within catchment area of structural flood defences, or people living in a community where other members have been trained in emergency flood response). People who receive low intensity support such as people falling within an administrative area of an institution (e.g. Ministry or local authority) receiving capacity building support, people within a catchment area of a river basin subject to a water resources management plan, or the entire population of a country with a strengthened weather or climate monitoring or forecasting system should not be included under this indicator. Sex: Reporting disaggregated by sex (male, female) is mandatory.  This may be estimated using the best available data on the composition of sex for the relevant population.  Data calculation: Both household and individual data can be utilized to report results under this indicator. Data on household size should be determined from the most recent census data or from a representative household survey. If data is collected at the household level, implementers will need to multiply the number of households by the average household size to calculate the number of people reported under this indicator.",The individuals reported under this indicator are better equipped to adapt to climate change and will be more resilient to the impacts of climate change.,Number of people,,Sex,,,,,Data will be collected by implementing partners with knowledge of their specific activities and programs.

Climate information may include, but is not limited to:  (1) data such as monitored weather or climate projections (e.g., anticipated temperature, precipitation and sea level rise under future scenarios), and  (2) the outputs of climate impact assessments, for example, the consequences of increased temperatures on crops, changes in stream flow due to precipitation shifts, or the number of people likely to be affected by future storm surges. Any adjustment or new approach to the management of resources or implementation of actions that responds to climate change risks and increases resilience should be considered under this indicator. Using climate information or implementing risk-reducing practices does not always involve expenditure of funds. For instance, a farmer may choose to harvest a crop earlier or plant a different crop due to a climate-related forecast.  Climate information can serve a variety of sectors such as agriculture, livestock, health, or natural resource or urban management. Using climate information may include, but is not limited to, conducting vulnerability assessments, creating plans or strategies for adaptation or resilience based on projected climate impacts, or selecting risk-reducing or resilience-improving actions to implement. Examples of risk-reducing actions may include, but are not limited to: - In the agriculture sector, actions may include changing the exposure or sensitivity of crops, better soil management, changing grazing practices, applying new technologies like improved seeds or irrigation methods, diversifying into different income-generating activities, using crops that are less susceptible to drought, salt and variability, or any other practices or actions that aim to increase predictability or productivity of agriculture under anticipated climate variability and change. - In the water sector, actions may aim to improve water quality, supply, and efficient use under anticipated climate variability and change. - In the health sector, actions may aim to prevent or control disease incidence and outcomes under anticipated climate variability and change outcomes. - In Disaster Risk Reduction, actions may aim to reduce the negative impacts of extreme events associated with climate variability and change. - In urban areas, actions may aim to improve the resilience of urban areas, populations, and infrastructure under anticipated climate variability and change.

This indicator includes finance mobilized (or leveraged), enabled by USG assistance,  for actions, activities, projects or programs that avoid, reduce, or sequester GHGs from sustainable landscapes activities.  Finance may be mobilized from the public sector (e.g. other governments or public multilateral entities) or private sector (e.g. corporate investments) and should help to advance the objectives established by the USG-supported program. USG funding should not be counted under this indicator.  Mobilized finance reported under this indicator should be disaggregated as domestic or international. Domestic finance is investment which originated within the country in which it is implemented (e.g. national government funds to support implementation of a project within that country) and international finance is cross-border finance (e.g. a private company based in one country contributing funds for a project in a different country).  Finance can be mobilized through a variety of instruments and vehicles, including common funding instruments, parallel investments, or in-kind support. Examples of the types of U.S. assistance that could mobilize finance include: Investments made possible by finance interventions, such as: - Grants (or in-kind support) for technical assistance - Loans - Equity or investment shares - Support for development and structuring of other financial instruments such as Green Bonds or Real Estate Investment Trusts  - Political, regulatory, or credit risk insurance and guarantees Investments made possible by policy interventions and technical assistance interventions, such as: - Market assessments, financier credit product development, project incubation and preparation; - Technical support for increasing the sustainability of supply chains; - Regulatory policy support for the creation or implementation of land-use planning; - Fiscal policy support to develop preferential tax treatment for climate-friendly technologies and environmentally related taxes; and - Information or data-based interventions such as setting up technology centers of excellence, labeling schemes, wind speed or solar radiation mapping. Examples of what mobilized funds may support include: improving the enabling environment for mitigation actions; enhancing processing and transport infrastructure for sustainably-produced goods, infrastructure for protected areas, etc.; funding the costs of climate change activities advanced by the program, monitoring climate change progress or outcomes; or sensitizing stakeholders to climate risks; land use issues and opportunities addressed through the program.",The mobilization of additional financial resources can help catalyze resources needed for transformational change and contribute to long-term sustainability and progress toward GCCI goals.,U.S. dollars (USD),,"Public, domestic, Public, international, Private, domestic, Private, international",,,,,"To report observed mobilization, project implementers will gather data about the amount of finance mobilized in the past fiscal year and report through standard reporting procedures.

This indicator reports the estimated quantity of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in metric tons of CO2-equivalent, reduced, sequestered, or avoided supported in full or in part by USG assistance, as compared to a baseline level of GHG emissions.  The baseline is the âbusiness-as-usualâ reference for GHG emissions that would have occurred during the reporting period if there had been no USG intervention.  This indicator is a calculated estimate, and often not the result of direct emissions measurements.  This indicator applies to estimated GHG emissions reductions from carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and other global warming pollutants. Relevant sectors for projects that may report on this indicator include, but are not limited to, climate change, natural resource management, agriculture, biodiversity, energy, industry, urban, and transport. This indicator applies to estimated emissions reduced, sequestered, or avoided, for the specified reporting period. This can include both emissions reductions from activities implemented during the reporting period as well as activities which were implemented during a previous reporting period, but are still achieving ongoing reductions in GHG emissions. Implementers are encouraged to include these continuing results by estimating tons of CO2e avoided during the current reporting period. Regarding land use-related emissions reductions or increased sequestration, if a U.S. government supported project continues to conserve the same hectares of land as in a previous reporting period, those hectares should be included in the calculations for the current reporting period to determine the emissions reductions of the project. The 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP) of gases from the IPCC 4th Assessment Report or later should be used for calculations.  FOR USAID ACTIVITIES: Land-Use Programs (including Sustainable Landscapes):  USAID has developed the Agriculture, Forest, and Other Land Use Carbon Calculator (AFOLU) using standard methodologies and some default data. All SL programs (focused or indirect) must reference and adhere to the methods and tools in the USAID AFOLU Carbon Calculator (http:/www.afolucarbon.org) if applicable, unless a more rigorous calculation is available.

This indicator measures the cumulative projected greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced, avoided and/or sequestered through 2030, in metric tons of CO2-equivalent, from the time the policy took effect or action was taken, through 2030. The measure, technology, or action may be supported in full or in part by USG assistance. It is acceptable to calculate the projected emissions reductions from a combination of adopted policies and/or actions to which USG assistance contributed. Policies and actions adopted since 2010 that have not been previously reported, may be included.  Relevant technologies include any sustainable landscapes related product, process, or infrastructure supported by USG assistance that is installed or adopted which can reduce, avoid or sequester greenhouse gas emissions. This indicator is applicable to all types of sustainable landscapes policies and actions, including, but not limited to, nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs), improved logging regulations, deforestation laws, payment for ecosystem services, improved agricultural practices, and deployment of technologies or implementation of sustainable landscapes activities that result in emission reductions. Results should be divided into three disaggregates: emissions reduced or avoided from the time action was taken or the policy took effect through 2020, from 2021 through 2025, and from 2026 to 2030. The sum of the three should be the total projected reduction or avoidance through 2030. Implementers may report on this indicator only once per adopted policy or action.  Reporting may occur in the year the policy was adopted, or the year the action was taken or implemented. Assessments of previously supported policies and actions, adopted since 2010, can be reported under this indicator.  In such cases, they may involve both ex post and ex ante estimates.   FOR USAID ACTIVITIES: OUs can refer to the WRI 2014 Policy and Action Standard for guidance on how to generate a 10 year projection (http://www.ghgprotocol.org/policy-and-action-standard).

At a minimum, the following materials and quantities should be included in the list of essential reading instructional materials for a classroom: - One reading instructional guide for each teacher - One student reading workbook per student  - One set of decodable readers per student - One set of supplemental reading materials per classroom Additional teaching and learning materials, such as educational recordings or flash cards may be included in the list of materials defining a âcomplete set,â however, the items listed above are a required minimum. Classroom materials such as pencils and chalk that do not convey instructional content should not be defined as part of the complete set. Within the parameters defined here, the categories and ratios of documents that constitute a complete set will be defined by the Mission in consultation with government counterparts, local reading experts, and USAID technical experts. For example, the precise definition of a complete set of supplemental reading materials should be tailored to the grade level and curriculum relevant to the classroom. A classroom cannot be counted as having a complete set of essential materials unless all required materials are available in the classroom in the appropriate ratio of materials to students and teachers. For example, if each type of material is present in the classroom, but there are only 50 student reading workbooks for 60 students, the collection is not complete.  Depending on the design of the materials, a ratio of one item per student may be appropriate, or a ratio of several items per student may be necessary a complete set. For example if a collection of decodable reading passages is incorporated into a single booklet, one booklet per student may be appropriate. Alternatively, if decodable reading passages are published separately, the full set of materials per student may be appropriate. Some essential materials, such as teacher guides, can be expected to last more than one year without replacement.

Output,Average,Average stockout rate of contraceptive commodities at Family Planning service delivery points,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Health,,"This indicator aligns with the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition (rhsupplies.org) universal stockout indicator.  The RHSC universal indicator is defined as the percentage of facilities stocked out, by family planning method offered, on the day of the assessment (reporting day or day of visit).  This indicator averages the RHSC universal stockout indicator across all reporting periods (where multiple reporting periods exist).    Example calculation, assuming the following dataset:  Male Condoms Reporting Period 1: 20% of SDPs stocked out Reporting Period 2: 10% of SDPs stocked outTo calculate this stockout indicator, make sure to take the average over all reporting periods for the year where multiple periods exist.             0.2 + 0.1 ---------------------------- = 0.15 =15% for Male Condoms                 2",The availability of contraceptives is a critical determinant of the success and long-term impact of any family planning program.

The indicator is used to help focus program investments for supply chain strengthening.  Where USG FP assistance is not directed at contraceptive donations or supply chain strengthening, this indicator can serve to flag where lack of supplies to clients may constrain the success of other program investments and where assistance for supply availability may be warranted. This indicator is used by USAID/W staff to support in-country managers in allocating resources and program support. This measure, in the aggregate, can also inform stakeholders (e.g., Congress) on how well programs that are supported by USAID are progressing towards reliable availability of family planning methods for clients.",,,,,,,,Investing in People: Health: Family Planning and Reproductive Health: HL. 7.6.,,"Points of clarification: 1. Being stocked out indicates having zero usable (non-expired, non-damaged) stock of the offered contraceptive method at the location being assessed. Ideally, the indicator will assess the inventory present in the entire facility, not just the facility store or pharmacy. However, we recognize that, in many cases, stockout information may only represent the facility store or pharmacy, because many stock records and reports only include data from this location; instead of also including what is in clinic rooms or other facility locations. 2. Offering the method refers to providing or managing it. A facility is considered to offer a method if it has stocked it or has issued/dispensed the method at some point during the last 12 months.  This indicatorâs definition does not consider the availability of trained providers.  Only facilities that offer a particular method are included in the stockout rate calculation for that method. 3. When collecting data by method, it will be important to determine whether facilities that offer more than one product brand or type within a product category were stocked out of all of them at the same time.  Contraceptive product categories include: Male Condoms, Female Condoms, Fertility-Awareness Based Method, Implantable Hormonal Contraceptive, Injectable Hormonal Contraceptive, Copper-bearing Intrauterine Devices, Hormone-releasing Intrauterine Devices, Oral Hormonal Contraceptive. For this indicator, a stockout indicates that there is no availble product from a given product category. For example, if a facility offers two injectable brandsâDepo-Provera and Noristeratâand, at the time of assessment, the facility was stocked out of Noristerat, but had stock of Depo-Provera; it would not be considered to be stocked out of injectables because it had Depo-Provera in stock.  Note that in country supply chains, we recommend collecting data by product, since different products need to be managed individually within the supply chain and because they are not necessarily interchangeable, e.g., a two-month vs. three-month injectable or a 3- vs. 5- year implant.  Furthermore, with product data, you can often calculate both product-specific stockout rates and you can aggregate and calculate method-specific stockout rates. You cannot do the reverse if you only collect the data by method. 4. The preferred data source for this indicator is stock ending balance information on LMIS reports; in the absense of SDP-level LMIS data, the data should be collected through physical inventory checks during facility visits, such as from health facility assessment results or supervision records.  For example, results from secondary sources which are collected annually, such as the UNFPA Facility Assessment for Reproductive Health Commodities and Services, the PMA2020 SDP survey, End Use Verification data, or the WHO SARA health facility survey can be used. 5. Multiple reporting periods would generally occur when a countryâs logistics management information system (LMIS) is used to compute the indicator.  Generally in such cases, the percentage of facilities stocked out would be averaged across monthly or quarterly LMIS data and across methods to compute this stockout indicator. 6. Family planning service delivery points (SDPs) should include all public sector SDPs offering family planning commodities.  Family Planning SDPs should also include all NGO, social marketing, and private sector SDPs that are USG-supported.

All other sanitation facilities do not meet this definition and are considered âunimproved.â Unimproved sanitation includes: flush or pour/flush toilets without a sewer connection; pit latrines without slab/open pit; bucket latrines; or hanging toilets/latrines. Households that use a facility shared with other households are not counted as using a basic sanitation facility. A household is defined as a person or group of persons that usually live and eat together. Persons are counted as âgaining accessâ to an improved sanitation facility, either newly established or rehabilitated from a non-functional or unimproved state, as a result of USG assistance if their household did not have similar âaccessâ, i.e., an improved sanitation facility was not available for household use, prior to completion of an improved sanitation facility associated with USG assistance.  This assistance may come in the form of hygiene promotion to generate demand. It may also come as programs to facilitate access to supplies and services needed to install improved facilities or improvements in the supply chain(s).   Limitations:  It is important to note that providing âaccessâ does not necessarily guarantee beneficiary âuseâ of a basic sanitation facility and thus potential health benefits are not certain to be realized from simply providing âaccess.â Not all household members may regularly use the noted basic sanitation facility. In particular, in many cultures young children are often left to defecate in the open and create health risks for all household members including themselves. The measurement of this indicator does not capture such detrimental, uneven sanitation behavior within a household. Additional limitations of this indicator are that it does not fully measure the quality of services, i.e. accessibility, quantity, and affordability, or the issue of facilities for adequate menstrual hygiene management.","Use of an improved sanitation facility by households is strongly linked to decreases in the incidence of waterborne disease among household members, especially among those under age five.

Safely managed sanitation services are those that effectively separate excreta from human contact, and ensure that excreta do not re-enter the immediate environment. This means that household excreta are contained, extracted, and transported to designated disposal or treatment site, or, as locally appropriate, are safely re-used at the household or community level. Persons are counted as âgaining accessâ to a safely managed sanitation service if their household did not previously have similar âaccessâ.

Health facilities may provide different levels of service, but it is anticipated that sanitation facilities will be installed in health facilities at the lower echelons of the service hierarchy. Health facilities may be public or private. A basic sanitation facility (see indicator HL.8.2-2) is one that provides privacy and hygienically separates human excreta from human contact and includes:     - flush or pour/flush facility connected to a piped sewer system;     - a septic system or a pit latrine with slab;    - composting toilets;     - or ventilated improved pit latrines (with slab).

For latrine blocks with several squat holes, the âsanitation facilityâ count is the number of squat holes in the block. Sanitation facilities that are repaired in order to meet set local government standards will also be counted. Sanitation facilities counted are only those that have hand washing facilities within or near the toilets and are located on premises of the institution. In school settings, there must be gender-specific sanitation facilities and host country standards regarding the ratio of students per squat hole must be met.

Outcome,HL.8.2-5,Percentage of  households with soap and water at a handwashing station commonly used by family members,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Health,,"A handwashing station is a location where family members go to wash their hands. In some instances, these are fixed locations where handwashing devices are built in and are permanently placed. But they may also be movable devices that may be placed in a convenient spot for family members to use. The measurement takes place via observation by an enumerator during the household visit.  The enumerator must see the soap and water at this station. The soap may be in bar, powder, or liquid form. Shampoo will be considered liquid soap. The cleansing product must be at the handwashing station or reachable by hand when standing in front of it. A âcommonly usedâ handwashing station, including water and soap, is one that can be readily observed by the enumerator during the household visit, and where study participants indicate that family members generally wash their hands. Limitations: The measurement of handwashing is difficult and should preferably be conducted by objective measures that do not rely on self-reports. The presence of a handwashing station does not guarantee use. However, this indicator has been shown to be linked with actual handwashing behavior and as such, is a useful proxy.","A clear link can be made between handwashing with soap among child caretakers at critical junctures and the reduction of diarrheal disease among children under five, one of the two major causes of child morbidity and mortality in developing countries.

HWT is also known as point of use, or POU, treatment, and comprises all methods with a peer-reviewed evidence base shown to  improve the microbiological quality of the water to WHO standards of <1 CFU fecal coliforms/100 ml sample.   Specific HWT technologies that are considered for this indicator include (alone or in combination to reach <1 CFU/100 ml):     - Chlorination (chemical disinfection)    - Flocculant/Disinfectant (physio-chemical disinfection)    - Filtration (physical removal)    - Solar disinfection (UV/heat disinfection)    - Boiling (disinfection via heat).  Correct practice of an HWT technology does not count towards indicators 8.1-1  (Number of people gaining access to a basic drinking water source), or 8.1-3 (Number of people receiving improved service quality from an existing basic  or safely managed drinking water service).  This indicator is focused on improving the quality of existing drinking water.  Limitations HWT is not universally effectively against all classes of waterborne pathogens (e.g. free chlorination is ineffective against Cryptosporidium), and requires substantial education and behavior change to ensure correct and consistent use.  ","The World Health Organization (WHO) argues that HWT âmay play an important role in protecting public health where existing water sourcesâ¦ are untreated, are not treated properly or become contaminated during distribution or storageâ (UNICEF & WHO, 2009).  The organization estimates that âlow cost interventions for household-based treatment of drinking water and safe storage can significantly reduce the pathogen load in drinking water and . . . reduce the risk of diarrheal disease.â In 2009, UNICEF and WHO adopted a comprehensive strategy for effective diarrhea control that includes household water treatment and safe storage as proven interventions to reduce child mortality. WHO advises that HWT technologies be considered âinterimâ solutions to reduce the disease burden owed to poor water quality. Among all HWT technologies, reductions in diarrheal disease owed to HWT intervention studies are often in the range of 15-50% (Clasen et al., 2007). HWT should serve as a temporary disease prevention measure until more efficacious household or community water treatment technologies can be put in place, along with a sustainable business model.

Output,HL.9-1,Number of children under five (0-59 months) reached with nutrition-specific interventions through USG-supported nutrition programs,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Health,,"Children under five: Children under five years are those zero to 59 months of age. They are often targeted by US-supported activities with nutrition objectives.  Reached by nutrition-specific interventions: A child can be counted as reached if s/he receives one or more of the following nutrition-specific interventions directly or through the mother/caretaker: 1. Behavior change communication interventions that promote essential infant and young child feeding behaviors including: - Immediate, exclusive, and continued breastfeeding - Appropriate, adequate and safe complementary foods from 6 to 24 months of age 2. Vitamin A supplementation in the past 6 months 3. Zinc supplementation during episodes of diarrhea 4. Multiple Micronutrient Powder (MNP) supplementation 5. Treatment of severe acute malnutrition 6. Treatment of moderate acute malnutrition  7. Direct food assistance of fortified/specialized food products (i.e. CSB+, Supercereal Plus, RUTF, RUSF, etc) Missions and IPs who have a strong justification may opt out of the requirement to disaggregate this indicator into the seven interventions and two sex disaggregates. For example, OUs may opt out if IPs rely on the government health system to collect this data and these disaggregates are not included in that system. The reason should be noted in the online PPR reporting database. In this case, Missions may  report solely the total number of children under 5 reached. If only some disaggregates are available then Missions should report both the total number and the number for each available disaggregate.  Projects that support Growth Monitoring & Promotion (GMP) interventions should report children reached under the BCC disaggregate (#1). Children are often reached through interventions that target adults such as mothers and caretakers. If, after birth, the child benefits from the intervention, then the child should be counted-- regardless of the primary recipient of the information, counseling, or intervention. For example, if a project provides counseling on complementary feeding to a mother, then the child should be counted as reached. Implementers should not count a child as reached during pregnancy. There is a separate standard indicator that enumerates the number of pregnant women reached (HL 9.3). A child reached directly or via a caretaker should be counted if s/he receives a product, participates in an activity, or accesses services from a USG-supported activity during the reporting year.  A child should not be counted as reached if the mother or caretaker was solely exposed to a mass media behavior change campaign such as radio messages. Children reached solely through community drama, comedy, or video shows should not be included. However, projects should still use mass communication interventions like dramas and radio shows to reinforce SBCC messages. If USAID is supporting a nutrition activity that is purchasing nutrition commodities (e.g. Vit A, zinc, MNPs) or providing âsignificantâ support for the delivery of the supplement, then the child should be counted as reached. Significant is defined as: a reasonable expectation that the intervention would not have occurred in the absence of USAID funding.  Children can be double-counted across the intervention disaggregates if they receive more than one intervention, but a unique number of children reached must be entered into the sex disaggregates.  In order to avoid double counting across interventions, the implementing partner should follow a two step process: 1. First, count each child by the type of intervention. For example a child whose mother receives counseling on exclusive breastfeeding and who also receives vitamin A during a child health day should be counted once under each intervention; 2. Second, eliminate double counting when estimating the total number of children under-5 reached  and to disaggregate by sex. The partner may develop a system to track individual children using unique identifiers or estimate the overlap between the different types of interventions and subtract it from the total. Please refer to the forthcoming FAQs and supplemental guidance document for more examples of how to avoid double counting.  In cases where disaggregation is not possible, the unique number of children reached will likely be the number of children reached reached through Vitamin A distribution campaigns, in countries that support them.  To avoid double counting across all USAID funded activities, the Mission should estimate the overlap between the different activities before reporting the aggregate number in the PPR. Please refer to the forthcoming FAQs and supplemental guidance for more information on how to limit double counting.  In CMAM projects some children who are discharged as âcuredâ may relapse and be readmitted at a later date. There are standard methods for categorizing children as ârelapsedâ, but due to loss to follow-up, it is generally not possible to identify these children. Therefore, a limitation of this indicator is that there may be some double counting of children who were treated for severe and/or moderate acute malnutrition and relapsed during the same fiscal year.  There are three nutrition PPR indicators (HL 9.1, HL 9.2, HL 9.3) that seek to measure children and pregnant women, reached. These indicators measure various age groups and interventions in the critical 1,000 day period of life from pregnancy to age two, as well as key interventions reaching children under 5 years of age. There is some degree of overlap in individuals reached across these indicators. Partners are allowed to double count children and mothers/caretakers reached across these PPR indicators since they seek to measure different underlying constructs. Note: The previous version of this indicator (indicator number 3.1.9-15) allowed projects to count the number of âcontactsâ rather than the number of individual children reached. The indicator now requires that numbers of unique children are reported, and not number of contacts. Moreover, the previous version of this indicator did not require disaggregation by type of intervention. Some projects will find it difficult to modify their data collection mechanisms to report against this modified indicator for FY2016 reporting. However, all operating units for which it is applicable should report against this indicator starting in FY2017.",Good coverage of evidence-based nutrition-specific interventions among children under 5 years of age is essential to prevent and treat malnutrition and to improve child survival.

In this case, a partner may conduct an annual population-based Survey in the activity's program area that provides the proportion of children under five reached with each particular USG-supported intervention and then apply that proportion to the total number of children under five reached. In cases where multiple partners are operating in the same area and beneficiaries are counted as reached through different monitoring systems, we encourage the use of coordinated annual Surveys between the partners with shared costs that would increase the ability of the mission to adjust for double counting.

Goal,A06,Maternal mortality ratio (per 100 000 live births),BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development),,Health,,"The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is the annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, per 100,000 live births, for a specified year.","Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries. The maternal mortality ratio represents the risk associated with each pregnancy, i.e. the obste- tric risk. It is also a Millennium Development Goal Indicator for monitoring Goal 5, improving maternal health. The indicator monitors deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth. It reflects the capacity of the health systems to provide effective health care in preventing and addressing the complications occurring during pregnancy and childbirth.","The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated by dividing recorded (or estimated) maternal deaths by total recorded (or estimated) live births in the same period and multiplying by 100,000. Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death. Maternal mortality ratio = (Number of maternal deaths / Number of live births) X 100,000. The maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. However, there are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take into account these data quality issues. Adjustments for underreporting and misclassification of deaths and model based estimates should be made in the cases where data are not reliable. Because maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used. This is very costly and may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross country or overtime comparisons. To reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS surveys measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy related mortality: regardless of cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth, or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio. Reproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these are maternal or pregnancy related.",Regional and global aggregates are based on weighted averages using the total number of live births as the weight. Aggregates are presented only if available data cover at least 50% of total live births in the regional or global grouping,,,,,,Vital registration with complete coverage and medical certification of cause of death.,,"Surveys, Census, Field Monitoring",End of Cycle ,,,,"WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and The World Bank have developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for underreporting and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modeling for countries with no reliable national level data. Data on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, UNPD, UNICEF, and WB. Data available from countries varies in terms of the source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. Currently, only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available, and do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in the estimation process, country-reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies. For the remainder of countries/territories - those with no appropriate maternal mortality data - a statistical model is employed to predict maternal mortality levels. However, the calculated point estimates with this methodology might not represent the true levels of maternal mortality. It is advised to consider the estimates together with the reported uncertainty margins where the true levels are regarded to lie. Predominant type of statistics: predicted.",,,,"Maternal mortality is difficult to measure. Vital registration and health information systems in most developing countries are weak, and thus, cannot provide an accurate assessment of maternal mortality. Even estimates derived from complete vital registration systems, such as those in developed countries; suffer from misclassification and underreporting of maternal deaths. Due to the very large confidence limits of maternal mortality estimates, the MDG statistics track trends only at the regional level. The country estimates are not suitable for assessing trends over time or for making comparisons between countries. As a result, it is recommended that process indicators, such as attendance by skilled health personnel at delivery and use of health facilities for delivery, be used to assess progress towards the reduction in maternal mortality.",,"Source: World Health Statistics 2011, Indicator compendium Comments: The ability to generate country, regional, and global estimates with higher precision and accuracy would be greatly facilitated if country civil registration systems were further improved. This improvement would reduce the need to conduct special maternal mortality studies (which are time-consuming, expensive, and of limited use in monitoring trends). The maternal mortality ratio should not be confused with the maternal mortality rate (whose denominator is the number of women of reproductive age), which reflects not only the risk of maternal death per pregnancy or birth but also the level of fertility in the population. The maternal mortality ratio (whose denominator is the number of live births) indicates the risk once a woman becomes pregnant, thus does not take fertility levels in a population into consideration.

Both the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS (UNGASS) have set goals of reducing HIV prevalence.","Standardized tools and methods of estimation have been developed by UNAIDS and WHO in collaboration with the UN-AIDS Reference Group on Estimation, Modeling and Projections. In countries with a generalized epidemic, national estimates of HIV prevalence are based on data generated by surveill nce systems that focus on pregnant women who attend a selected number of sentinel antenatal clinics, and in an increasing number of countries on nationally representative serosurveys. In countries with a low level or concentrated epidemic national estimates of HIV prevalence are primarily based on surveillance data collected from populations at high risk (sex workers, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users) and estimates of the size of populations at high and low risk. This data is entered into the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) software which fits a simple epidemiological model to the epidemic structure defined. EPP finds the best fitting curve that describes the evolution of adult HIV prevalence over  time, and calibrates that curve based on prevalence found in any national surveys or default values in case there is no national survey available. For countries with very little available prevalence data (less than three consistent surveillance sites) a point prevalence esti- mate and projection is made using spreadsheet models (the Workbook Method). The resulting point prevalence estimates for several years are entered into EPP to find the best fitting curve that describes the evolution of adult HIV prevalence over time.

The main indicator proposed for monitoring progress towards achieving the international goals is HIV prevalence among  young people aged 15-24 years, which is a better proxy for monitoring HIV incidence. Although countries are moving to- wards collecting better data on young people, mainly by capturing data on young pregnant women attending antenatal clinics or national population based surveys, comparable data availability is still limited.

Both the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS (UNGASS) have set goals of reducing HIV prevalence.,"Standardized tools and methods of estimation have been developed by UNAIDS and WHO in collaboration with the UN- AIDS Reference Group on Estimation, Modelling and Projections. In countries with a generalized epidemic, national estimates of HIV prevalence are based on data generated by surveillance systems that focus on pregnant women who attend a selected number of sentinel antenatal clinics, and in an increasing number of countries on nationally representative serosurveys. In countries with a low level or concentrated epidemic na- tional estimates of HIV prevalence are primarily based on surveillance data collected from populations at high risk (sex workers, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users) and estimates of the size of populations at high and low risk. This data is entered into the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) software which fits a simple epidemiological model to the epidemic structure defined. EPP finds the best fitting curve that describes the evolution of adult HIV prevalence over time, and calibrates that curve based on prevalence found in any national surveys or default values in case there is no national survey available. For countries with very little available prevalence data (less than three consistent surveillance sites) a point prevalence esti- mate and projection is made using spreadsheet models (the Workbook Method). The resulting point prevalence estimates for several years are entered into EPP to find the best fitting curve that describes the evolution of adult HIV prevalence over time.

The extent of uncertainty depends mainly on the type of epidemic, and the quality, coverage and consistency of a countryâs surveillance system and, in generalized epidemics, whether or not a population-based survey with HIV testing was conducted. The main indicator proposed for monitoring progress towards achieving the international goals is HIV prevalence among young people aged 15-24 years, which is a better proxy for monitoring HIV incidence. Although countries are moving towards collecting better data on young people, mainly by capturing data on young pregnant women attending antenatal clinics ornational population based surveys, comparable data availability is still limited.

Goal,A08,STI prevalence in population sub- groups (%),BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development),,Health,,The number of people living with a defined STI most accurately diagnosed by highly specific and sensitive laboratory techniques during a given point in time.,"Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are a major cause of global ill-health. STIs are defined as infections that spread primarily through person-to-person sexual contact. However, several of these infections in particular HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B, can also be transmitted via mother-to-child-transmission during pregnancy and childbirth, blood product or tissue transfer. There are more than 30 different sexually transmissible bacteria, viruses and parasites. Although STIs are widespread in the overall population, STIs are a particular problem in defined populations at risk such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, or injecting drug users. As many STIs are either asymptomatic or share clinical signs and symptoms with more than one STI, STI prevalence studies ought to use sensitive and specific laboratory tests for diagnosis.","Special surveys are often used to establish prevalence data on selected STIs of particular interest such as gonorrhea, chlamydia or syphilis. These are usually done in selected population sub-groups, commonly high risk-group such as sex workers. National representative data are rarely available, except for syphilis and HIV. Sentinel surveillance in pregnant women is established in a few countries to estimate national and sub-national syphilis prevalence.",,,,,,,Special Surveys in at-risk populations Case reporting of notifiable STIs Houshold Surveys,,"Surveys, Field Monitorig",not available,,,,Survey and sentinel survey prevalence data,,,,"Data from sentinel surveys in pregnant women face the problem that they are likely to overestimate the prevalence in the overall population. Pregnant women are sexually active. Data cannot be used to extrapolate prevalence for the over- all population because this includes people who are and who are not sexually active. However, sentinel survey estimates in pregnant women may also underestimate prevalence due to the   healthy pregnant womenâ effect which describes that healthy women are more likely to get pregnant and are thus more unlikely to have certaindiseases such as chlamydia, which  can cause infertility. The extent to which sentinel data in pregnant women over or under estimates population prevalence depends on the disease studied and the age group of the surveyed population.",,Prevalence data of a few STIs might reflect changes in test sensitivity and specificity. This is one reason why in many countries the prevalence of Chlamydia has increased. Thus temporal comparison should be carefully interpreted and test sensitivity and specificity need to be taken into consideration before any conclusions can be drawn.,,,,,,

It is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which most commonly affects the lung. TB is treatable with six-month course of antibiotics but mortality is high even under treatment.

Incidence can change as the result of changes in transmission (the rate at which people become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis), or changes in the rate at which people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop TB disease (e.g. as a result of changes in nutritional status or of HIV infection). Because TB can develop in people who became infected many years previously, the effect of TB control on incidence is less rapid than the effect on prevalence or mortality.

Goal,A11,"Adolescent fertility rate (per 100 women, 15-19- years old)",BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development),,Health,,"The annual number of births to women aged 15-19 years per 1,000 women in that age group. It is also referred to as the age-specific fertility rate for women aged 15-19.","The adolescent birth rate, technically known as the age-specific fertility rate provides a basic measure of reproductive health focusing on a vulnerable group of adolescent women. There is substantial agreement in the literature that women who be- come pregnant and give birth very early in their reproductive lives are subject to higher risks of complications or even death during pregnancy and birth and their children are also more vulnerable. Therefore, preventing births very early in a womanâs life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience a curtailment of their opportunities for socio-economic im-provement, particularly because young mothers are unlikely to keep on studying and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate provides also indirect evidence on access to reproductive health since the youth, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to reproductive health care.","The adolescent birth rate is generally computed as a ratio. The numerator is the number of live births to women 15 to 19 years of age, and the denominator an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women 15 to 19 years of age. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration, survey and census data. (a) In the case of civil registration the numerator is the registered number of live-births born to women 15 to 19 years of age during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15 to 19. (b) In the case of survey data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed based on retrospective birth histories. The nu- merator refers to births to women that were 15 to 19 years of age at the time of the birth during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator to person-years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 by the interviewed women during the same reference period. Whenever possible, the reference period corresponds to the five years preceding the survey. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys, no retrospective birth histories are available and the estimate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey. (c) In the case of census data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for underregistration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own-children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census. (http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx, accessed 19 October 2009)","The United Nations Population Division compiles and updates data on adolescent fertility rate for MDG monitoring. Estimates based on civil registration are provided when the country reports at least 90 per cent coverage and when there is reasonable agreement between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Survey estimates are only provided when there is no reliable civil registration. Given the restrictions of the UN MDG database, only one source is provided by year and country. In such cases precedence is given to the survey programme conducted most frequently at the country level, other survey programmes using retrospective birth histories, census and other surveys in that order.

Goal,A12,Total fertility rate (per woman),BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development),,Health,Maternal Health and Newborn Care,The average number of children a hypothetical cohort of women would have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a given period and if they were not subject to mortality. It is expressed as children per woman.,"This is one of the most commonly used summary indicators of the level of fertility. An important property of the total fertility rate is that it is not affected by the age distribution of the population, although it can be affected by rapid changes in birth timing. The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action encourages countries to take the necessary steps to complete a demographic transition, understanding that an imbalance between demographic rates and social, economic and environmental goals, together with unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, has serious implications for sustainable development. In countries where fertility is still high, large young populations create major challenges for health services, education and employment. As such it represents a leading indicator of future change. In the absence of other information, a high fertility rate is assumed to be a general indication of health impairments and low life expectancy, low living standards, low status of women, and low levels of education. In the process of economic development and accompanying social change, the fertility and population growth rate decline as conditions improve, and po- tential parents choose to have fewer children by practicing contraception, which may be made available by family planning programs. Accordingly, the fertility rate is anticipated to respond to development and to the provision of family planning services and is monitored as evidence of their achievement.","Total fertility rate is directly calculated as the sum of age-specific fertility rates (usually referring to women aged 15 to 49 years), or five times the sum if data are given in five-year age groups. An age- or age-group-specific fertility rate is calculated as the ratio of annual births to women at a given age or age-group to the population of women at the same age or age-group, in the same year, for a given country, territory, or geographic area.

It is a good indicator of health system performance.,"Distinction is made between situations where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where the data are likely compromised and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage. While there are frequently general trends in immunization coverage levels, no attempt is made to fit data points using smoothing techniques or time series methods. The estimates are informed and constrained by the following heuristics: Country-specific: Each country's data are reviewed individually; data and information are not ""borrowed"" from other countries. If national data are available from a single source, the estimates are based solely on that source, supplemented with linear interpolation to impute values for years where data are not available. If no data are available for the most recent estimation period, the estimate remains the same as the previous year's. If new data or information subsequently become available, the relevant portion of the time series is updated. Consistent trends and patterns: If survey data tend to confirm (e.g., within +/- 10% points) reported data, the estimates are based on reported data. If multiple survey points show a fairly consistent relationship with the trend in reported data and the survey data are significantly different from reported data, the estimates are based on reported data calibrated to the level established by the survey data. If survey data are inconsistent with reported data and the survey data appear morereliable, coverage estimatesare based on survey data and interpolation between survey data points for intervening years. If multiple data points are available for a given country, vaccine/dose, and year data points are not averaged; rather potential biases in each of the sources are considered and an attempt to construct a consistent pattern over time, choosing data with the least potential for bias consistent with temporal trends and comparisons between vaccines is made. If coverage patterns are inconsistent between vaccines and dose number, an attempt to identify and adjust for possible biases is made. If inconsistent patters are explained by programmatic (e.g., vaccine shortage) or contextual events (e.g., ""international incidences"") the estimates reflect the impact of these events. When faced with situations where several estimates are possible, alternative explanations that appear to cover the observed data are constructed and treated as competing hypotheses, local information is considered, potential biases in the data identified and the more likely hypothesis identified.Recall bias adjustment: In instances where estimates are based primarily on survey data and the proportion of vaccinations based on maternal recall is high, survey coverage levels are adjusted to compensate for maternal recall for multi -dose antigens (i.e., DTP, POL, HepB and Hib) by applying the dropout between the first and third doses observed in the documented data to the vaccination history reported by the child's caretaker. No coverage greater than 100%: Coverage levels in excess of 100% are occasionally reported. While such coverage levels are theoretically possible, they are more likely to be the results of systematic error in the ascertainment of the numerator or the denominator, a mid-year change in target age-groups, or inclusion of children outside the target age group in the numerator. The highest estimate of coverage is 99%. Local knowledge incorporated: By consulting local experts an attempt to put the data in a context of local events - those occurring in the immunization system (e.g. vaccine shortage for parts of the year, donor withdrawal, change in management or policies, etc.) as well as more widely-occurring events (e.g. international incidences, civil unrest, etc.) is made. Information on such events is used to support (or challenge) sudden changes in coverage levels. Description and dissemination of results: For each country, year and vaccine/dose the WHO and UNICEF estimates are pre- sented in both graphic and tabular forms along with the data upon which they are based. The estimates are ""thickened"", by providing a description of the assumptions and decisions made in developing the specific estimates. Predominant type of statistics: unadjusted and adjusted",,,,,,,Facility reporting system Household Surveys,,"Reviews of Official Records, Surveys, Census",Annual ,,,,Global and regional coverage is a weighted sum of WHO/UNICEF estimates of national coverage by target population from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects. The size of the target population is the national annual number of infants surviving their first year of life.,,,,"One of the perceived weaknesses of the estimates is related to the subjective nature of our methods. Subjectivity arises primarily in 1) the choice of rules, and 2) the decision as to which rule should apply in a given circumstance. We have no theoretical foundation for our selection of rules and no validation of their reliability; the choices have been based on appeals to rationality, consistency and the lack of alternatives that produce more reasonable estimates. We are currently formalizing the rules to provide more explicit, consistent and replicable grounds for our estimates. A serious limitation of the current estimates is the absence of any articulation of uncertainty; as presented, the estimates appear equally precise and certain. The uncertainty in the estimates is rooted in the accuracy and precision of the empirical data (described above) and in the choice and application of the heuristics (model-based uncertainty). We are currently exploring methods to determine the likely error in empirical data and the additional uncertainty introduced by our methods.",,"The quality of the estimates are determined by the quality and availability of empirical data. Vaccination is relatively easy to measure and two methods - facility reports and surveys - have been developed, each of which, when properly designed and implemented, provides accurate and reliable direct measures of coverage levels. Implemented jointly, they provide a validation of coverage levels. However, both methods are subject to biases. In some instances, these biases may be identified and corrected and we have attempted to do so. These data are supplemented with local consultations that often explain inconsistencies and anomalies in the data and provide insight into forces that influence coverage levels. WHO and UNICEF are working closely with countries to improve the quality and usefulness of coverage monitoring data systems.",,,,,,"World Health Statistics 2011, Indicator compendium"
Outcome,B05,Polio 3 doses in 1-year-old-children (12-23 months),BMZ (Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development),,Health,,The percentage of 1-year-old children (12-23 months) who have received three doses of polio vaccine.,"Immunization is an essential component of efforts for reducing under-five-mortality. Polio immunization coverage together with Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis immunization coverage constitutes key indicators to monitor progress in child health. Polio immunization schemes differ between countries. Countries might use the scheme: immunization at birth, 4, 8, 12 weeks or 3 doses within the first year of life (months 3, 4, 5) followed by two more vaccinations in month 18 and with 5 years of age. Polio is targeted for eradication. High coverage levels of vaccination in children against polio need to be achieved and maintained even in polio-free regions of the world to prevent any outbreak of the wild virus. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication efforts. Although it would be best to have an indicator of full immunization (5 doses) in 5 years old children to monitor full immunization status, the indicator of thee doses in 1-year-old-children is preferable due to better data availability.","Distinction has to be made between countries where data reported by national authorities accurately reflect immunization system performance and those where data are likely to be compromised by data quality and may present a misleading view of immunization coverage.

Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by âcurrently usingâ a method of contraception. When data on contraceptive use among married or in-union women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information on contraceptive prevalence for the next most comparable group of persons is reported. Illustrations of base populations that are sometimes presented are: sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), ever-married women, or men and women who are married or in union. When information on current use is not available, data on use of contraceptive methods at last sexual intercourse or during the previous year are utilized. Footnotes are employed to indicate any differences between the data presented and the standard definition of contraceptive prevalence. In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for non-traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (according to method, age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc) or when analyzing trends over time.

Therefore, asking about a particular and recent act of sex may give a more robust and accurate measure of levels of condom use with clients. If both questions are asked, the âlast clientâ question should precede the âalways, sometimes, neverâ question. The difference between the two answers can be useful for program purposes. For example, what proportion of those who report having used a condom during the last sex act also report that they are not regular condom users? Do any sex workers who claim to always use condoms with their clients also report that they did not use one with their last client?

Estimating the denominator: The number of people who need antiretroviral therapy in a country is estimated using statistical modeling methods. In response to the emergence of new scientific evidence, in December 2009 WHO updated its antiretroviral therapy guide- lines for adults and adolescents. According to the new guidelines, which were developed in consultation with multiple technical and implementing partners, all adolescents and adults, including pregnant women, with HIV infection and a CD4 count at or below 350 cells/mm3 should be started on antiretroviral therapy, regardless of whether or not they have clini- cal symptoms.

Payment for health is considered catastrophic when it exceeds a defined level of household income and so leads the household to sacrifice the consumption of other goods and services necessary for well-being. Many of those who do seek care are confronted with catastrophic costs exceeding their financial abilities and they might suffer impoverishment as a consequence. Others might be deterred from usingneeded services.

Catastrophic spending on health is mostly defined as spending of at least 10% of total household expenditures. But also other thresholds are used and varying thresholds for socioeconomic groups are suggested. This indicator provides an estimate how well people are protected from catastrophic spending in case of illness. It therewith provides an important outcome indicator on financial protection.

Also, the measurement does not include income loss, which is in some societies more important than spending on health. The threshold of at least 10% might not be sensitive in all income groups. Moreover, some authors propose to use concentration indices because catastrophe is not linear. Also variable threshold levels are applied. A major limitation of any measurement of expenses such as out-of-pocket expenses, catastrophic costs or impoverishment is that they do not include the population which forgo health services because they are unable to pay.",,Comparability of estimates between surveys with different sequences of questions and recall periods are limited. The 10percentage threshold is somehow arbitrary.

See USAID/MCHIP guidance (link under question format) for guidance and survey tool","This is a core indicator for measuring nutritional status of infants. Determining age can be challenging, see guidence on this from WHO (2010, page 18). Unicef (2007, page 5) writes: â¢ This is the first in the series of current status indicators based on recall of the previous day and includes living infants. All indicators that follow are also based on recall of the previous day. â¢ Using the previous day recall period will cause the proportion of exclusively breastfed infants to be overestimated, as some infants who are given other liquids irregularly may not have received them in the day before the survey. â¢ As with other indicators that are based on current status, exclusive breastfeeding is based on a cross section of children in a given age range, in this case children from birth to just under 6 months of age. It does therefore not represent the proportion of infants that are exclusively breastfed until just under 6 months of age and should not be interpreted as such. It is generally accepted that the proportion of children that are exclusively breastfed until just under 6 months of age is lower than the number derived from the indicator of current status. For example, if there is a linear rate of decline in the proportion exclusively breastfed from 100% at birth to 20% at 6 months, the indicator value for exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months would be 60% (as compared to 20% still exclusively breastfed at 6 months). However, the indicator recommended in this document represents the best option for estimating exclusive breastfeeding and is more sensitive to capturing changes. If there is interest in identifying differences in proportions exclusively breastfed over smaller age ranges, creation of figures such as shown in Annexes 3, and disaggregation (by age) as suggested in the bullet below may provide such information.""",,From DIG Indicator Handbook 2014 (also FFP indicator and MCHIP/USAID- sometimes worded slightly different),,,,,,
Goal,2 (3.1.9-11),Prevalence of stunted children under five years of age,USAID (U.S. Agency for International Development),,Health,Child Health Nutrition,"Stunting is a height-for-age measurement that is a reflection of chronic undernutrition. This indicator measures the percent of children 0-59 months who are stunted, as defined by a height for age Z score < -2. Although different levels of severity of stunting can be measured, this indicator measures the prevalence of all stunting, i.e. both moderate and severe stunting combined. While stunting is difficult to measure in children 0-6 months and most stunting occurs in the -9-23 month range (1,000 days), this indicator reports on all children under 59 months to capture the impact of interventions over time and to align with DHS data.

Stunting is an indicator of linear growth retardation, most often due to prolonged exposure to an inadequate diet and poor health. Reducing the prevalence of stunting among children, particularly 0- 23 months, is important because linear growth deficits accrued early in life are associated with cognitive impairments, poor educational performance, and decreased work productivity among adults. Better nutrition leads to increased cognitive and physical abilities, thus improving individual productivity in general, including improved agricultural productivity.

Flesh foods and other misc. small animal protein; 7. Vitamin A dark green leafy vegetables; 8. Other Vitamin A rich vegetables and fruits; 9. Other fruits and vegetables The Mean number of food groups consumed by women of reproductive age indicator is tabulated by averaging the number of food groups consumed (out of the nine food groups above) across all women of reproductive age in the sample with data on dietary diversity. To collect data for this indicator, a more disaggregated set of food groups than the nine food groups above should be used in the questionnaire (See Feed the Future M&E Guidance Series Volume 8: Population-Based Survey Instrument for Feed the Future Zone of Influence Indicators.)

No level,,Number of people with sustainable access to clean drinking water sources through DFID support,DFID (Department for International Development),UKAID,"Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)",,"The bilateral results attributable to DFID will be those from direct investment in improved drinking water sources. The results are based on the ânumber of water points built or rehabilitatedâ multiplied by the ânumber of beneficiaries per water pointâ. An improved drinking-water source is defined as one that, by nature of its construction or through active intervention, is protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with faecal matter. Improved facilities include piped water into dwelling; piped water to yard/plot; public tap or standpipe; tubewell or borehole; protected dug well; protected spring; and rainwater. This indicator excludes temporary facilities constructed as part of humanitarian interventions and other temporary means of water provision (e.g. bottles). Permanent facilities constructed under humanitarian programmes should be included. The preferred data source for this indicator is programme data on direct beneficiaries and this should capture only individuals who have gained access to clean drinking water sources as defined within this methodology which they did not previously have. If alternative data sources are used, care must also be taken to establish the counterfactual - i.e. the number or proportion of people who already had access to clean drinking water sources according to the definitions outlined in this methodology. This may not always be clearcut. In the case of providing access to safe drinking water in urban areas, for example, individuals reached with the intervention may already have had some access to clean water but this access is now improved (and is now available perhaps for longer periods of time, at a smaller distance or as a protected source). The judgement is whether the level of access has improved from not meeting the definitions within the methodology notes to now meeting the definitions after the intervention. Please make conservative estimates in this respect and contact the WASH policy team if clarification is required. Each individual should be counted only once, even if the same individual benefits from multiple interventions in different years. This indicator refers to sustainability. Measuring sustainability is challenging and would require monitoring well beyond the timespan of the DFID Results Framework. It therefore is not possible to require that all interventions are verified as sustainable. However, sustainability should be considered within project design and monitoring. Note that unlike the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), this indicator measures access rather than use. In this sense, the indicators are generally aligned with other DFID Results Framework indicators which are pitched at output rather than outcome level. Measuring use and attributing the results to DFID would be challenging and potentially more subjective.","Lack of water supply has negative impacts on poverty reduction, gender equity, child health, and education. Ensuring everyone has access to safe water supply is a high priority for the coalition government. ","Number of people with sustainable access to clean drinking water sources through DFID support Type of indicator: Cumulative - annual results are reported and summed over the entire reporting period, assuming that each individual is counted within one year only.",,,,"Baselines vary by country and âresults achieved between baseline and milestone 1â should be reported in the DRF template in addition to results for 2011/12 onwards where applicable. For projects, baseline data should be collected at the start of the project.",,Good performance will be if the project is on track to meet the target set out in the logframe,"Provision should be included in projects and programmes for the collection of data on improved access to water directly attributable to the intervention. This will normally be the primary source of data. Where water results are delivered through non-specific WASH programmes, for instance health, education, social development or livelihoods, projects will need to collect WASH data in addition to other project data. Data on household size, where needed, should be determined from recent national census data or from a nationally representative household survey. In the case of sector and budget support, output level data (i.e. the number of water points built/rehabilitated) is the preferred starting point before attributing DFIDâs share of results. If this is not available, national statistical data should be used but in this case, funding in the sector from other sources should be considered in addition to the government budget when calculating DFIDâs share of total expenditure . Water coverage is a key indicator that we would expect to be included in partner countries national statistical record and which would provide the basic data required. The Joint Monitoring Programme of WHO/UNICEF (http://www.wssinfo.org/) publishes a report every 2 years using data on use of improved water supply and basic sanitation from surveys and censuses. The resulting international database of coverage provides a useful reference to assess the validity of country data (but should not be used as a primary source, output level data is preferred). Where we are funding through multilateral partners at a country level, they should be requested to collect WASH specific data to demonstrate results achieved.",,,not available,,,"Country offices should report this on this indicator through the DFID Results Framework data collection system. In reporting on this indicator the country office will take primary responsibility for ensuring adequate baseline data is available and that programmes include suitable indicators and requirements for regular measurement. Where direct budget support or sector support is being provided, country offices should determine the share of national results that can be attributed to DFID support (see general guidance on the DRF teamsite). Use of figures on output level results (access to WASH services) is preferred.","Indicator = (c+r) x b where: c = number of water points constructed r = number of water points rehabilitated b = number of beneficiaries per water point A common example of b is where b = n x h n = average number of households served by each water point h = average number of people per householdi . In many cases, multipliers âbâ for a variety of interventions will have been developed in each country. For example, the value of b will differ for different types of water point constructed and in different locations. WASH results achieved through DFID core funding to multilateral organisations will be considered separately, following an agreed approach across DFID. Only bilateral results (including âbilateral through a multilateralâ) should be included in the DRF template. It is important to avoid double counting of results. If the same people are beneficiaries in multiple years then the results for each year cannot be added together. It is unlikely that this will be the case with providing clean water facilities but any potential areas of double counting should be considered. However if the number of people able to access water points increases over the life of the programme/project the larger number can be used when reporting results. Where countries are supporting clean water provision through multiple funding mechanisms e.g. nonGovernment programmes, sector budget support and general budget support there are significant risks of double counting. Calculations to avoid this can be complex. Please contact the statistics lead on WASH for further advice. Where facilities are provided within public buildings such as schools or clinics but are not freely accessible to a community, the number of people reached cannot be included in this access indicator as their access is considered partial, in contrast to household access. Data on these kinds of facilities should be collected for project monitoring but should not be included in the DRF template. However, facilities provided within a community which can be accessed freely by all members of that community (e.g. a shared, protected spring) may be included. Judgement may be required and the WASH team can provide advice if necessary. Note that this calculation does not include a measure of whether the water sources remain in use after a given period of time, i.e. it does not include a measure of the sustainability of the intervention. This data should be collected where possible for project monitoring purposes",,Data collection and analysis is likely to take a minimum of six to twelve months. Results achieved in previous years should be reported against that year as data becomes available.,"It is recognised that the quality of data available to estimate the number of unique people reached with access to clean drinking water as defined in this note will vary. Please indicate any concerns in this respect in the results template. The JMP of UNICEF/World Health Organisation collates and analyses data on use of water and sanitation facilities from a range of developing countries every 2 years. JMP uses national sources of data and a common indicator definition to estimate progress in the sector. This provides an independent assessment of countryâs own estimates of progress. Please note that this is a complementary, quality assurance measure which may not be directly comparable with DFIDâs indicators.","It is important to note that DFIDâs methodology is consistent with the approach used by national government and multilateral organisations but is different to the JMP methodology that measures the number of people using improved sources of water. The JMP methodology includes people who gain access through self -supply but does not include people who live near an improved source but are excluded from using it for social, economic or other reasons.",,"DFID provides 10% of the cost of a programme that has constructed 4,000 improved water sources and rehabilitated 1,000 water sources.

Apablaza, and E. Jung (2014). “Multidimensional Poverty Measurement for EU-SILC Countries.” OPHI Research in Progress 36d.",,,,"Multidimensional poverty assessments aim to measure the non-income based dimensions of poverty, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the extent of poverty and deprivation. Several international multidimensional poverty tools exist, including the EU-2020 official poverty measure (combining income, work, and material deprivation), UNDP’s MPI (a headline index summarizing the proportion of people in poverty and the intensity of their poverty, which breaks down by indicator), the “Bristol” methodology to measure multidimensional poverty of children, UNICEF’s MODA (multidimensional poverty of children), and IFAD’s MPAT (10 separate indicators).
The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is published by the UNDP’s Human Development Report Office and tracks deprivation across three dimensions and 10 indicators: health (child mortality, nutrition), education (years of schooling, enrollment), and living standards (water, sanitation, electricity, cooking fuel, floor, assets).1 It first identifies which of these 10 deprivations each household experiences, then identifies households as poor if they suffer deprivations across one -third or more of the weighted indicators.2 Based on the Alkire Foster methodology, the MPI is created by multiplying together two numbers: the percentage of the population who are poor; and the average percentage of the weighted indicators that poor people experience (intensity). Including intensity provides an incentive to reach the poorest of the poor. The MPI reflects those in acute poverty; alternative cutoffs are used to report those who are vulnerable and those in severe poverty.
To ensure our conceptualization of multidimensional poverty is firmly rooted in the Open Working Group Outcome Document and proposed SDGs, we support the creation of a revised MPI. At a minimum this “MPI2015” would track extreme deprivation in nutrition, health, education, water, sanitation, clean cooking fuel, and reliable electricity, to show continuity with MDG priorities. More specifically it would reflect the following deprivations:

Adult or child malnourishment
Disrupted or curtailed schooling (a minimum of years 1-8)
The absence of any household member who has completed 6 years of schooling
Child mortality within the household within the last 5 years
Lack of access to safe drinking water
Lack of access to basic sanitation services
Lack of access to clean cooking fuel
Lack of basic modern assets (radio, TV, telephone, computer, bike, motorbike, etc.)
Lack of access to reliable electricity

Potential additional indicators to reflect the SDGs include work; housing; violence; social protection; quality of schooling; health system functioning; teenage marriage or pregnancy; solid waste disposal; birth registration; internet access (as suggested by the MPPN3); farm assets and a household’s vulnerability to economic shocks and those posed by natural hazards (see MPAT’s dimensions4) and/or quality of work; and empowerment or psychological wellbeing (see OPHI’s Publications5).
Although it might seem preferable to determine multidimensional poverty based on deprivation in any indicator, previous MPIs have found considerable abnormalities in using only one deprivation, partly because of cultural and climactic diversity, and partly because the scale of these deprivations varies widely. Determining poverty levels in a country like India on the basis of any single deprivation would result in poverty rates above 90%, potentially obscuring the considerable progress that has been made in one or more areas and disincentivizing political action.6 We therefore propose using the Alkire and Foster method of calculation,7and setting a threshold of multiple deprivations,8 to determine who is or is not considered poor. Establishing the thresholds will require participatory discussions as well as expert consultation. Complementary National and Regional MPIs could also be designed for specific contexts, as Mexico, Columbia, Philippines, South Africa and Bhutan have done.9",,,,"An MPI based on the Alkire and Foster method has the potential to be disaggregated by both regions and groups.10 At present MPI is disaggregated by rural-urban for 106 countries, decomposed by 780 subnational regions, and by some ethnic groups. A linked measure assesses inequality among the poor. Although identification is at the household level, if the MPI is disaggregated by sex and age category it shows MPI affects women and children disproportionately.
Additional modules can be used to develop individual-level adult and child poverty measures.11 It is especially important to consider the multidimensional poverty of children to capture children’s experiences of poverty and their consequences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a general rule, we recommend that the SDG indicator framework do not include any composite indices (see principles in section III), but we believe the MPI should be included for a number of reasons. The index provides the only comprehensive measure available for non-income poverty, which has become a critical underpinning of the SDGs. Critically the MPI comprises variables that are already reported under the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) and Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), so it would not increase the statistical burden to NSOs or the international community.
Dependency on high-quality household survey data has its limitations. The number of countries producing such surveys has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, to around 130 countries at present, but surveys remain irregular. Furthermore, many of the data for developed countries, such as the EU’s Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (available for 31 countries), are incompatible with data from developing countries, undermining our ability to prepare a global comparative measure.

Goal,,Percentage of eligible population covered by national social protection programs,"Administrative data, or household surveys if not available.",,,,"Access to adequate social protection is recognized as a basic right, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but more than half of the world’s population lacks national social protection coverage.1 This indicator measures the percentage of the eligible population covered by these social safety nets. The ILO includes the following 10 elements as part of comprehensive social security coverage: medical care; sickness benefits; protection for disability, old age and survivorship, maternity, children, unemployment, and employment injury; and general protection against poverty and social exclusion.2 The most common types of social protection are labor market interventions to promote employment and protect workers, social insurance such as health or unemployment insurance, and social assistance to support vulnerable individuals or households. New instruments of social protection have also gained popularity, including conditional cash transfers.",,,,"By sex, age, urban/rural, and by type (medical, employment, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In practice, access to social security can be limited by discrimination, which may not be captured here.",,,,,,
Goal,,"Percentage of women, men, indigenous peoples, and local communities with secure rights to land, property, and natural resources, measured by (i) percentage with documented or recognized evidence of tenure, and (ii) percentage who perceive their rights are recognized and protected.","For the documentation aspect, information from administrative data, census data, and household surveys. For the perception variable, added questions to opinion surveys or household surveys.",,,,"Whether women, men, indigenous peoples, and local communities can have secure tenure over the land, property, and other natural resources has important implications for economic development and poverty reduction.1 Yet, for many poor women, men, indigenous peoples, and communities, access to land, property, and other natural resources is increasingly undermined. In rural areas in particular, controversies involving large-scale land acquisitions by foreign and domestic investors for agribusiness, forestry, extractive, or other large-scale projects have placed land rights and the issue of responsible investment firmly on the global development agenda, and highlighted the importance of ensuring secure tenure rights for those who rely on land and natural resources for their well-being and livelihoods. Securing tenure rights is especially important for indigenous peoples, for whom lands, territories, and other resources may also hold significant spiritual or cultural import and have implications for their right to development.2
Secure rights to tenure in urban areas are also vital. The absence of security of tenure for urban dwellers over their housing and property can have important implications for economic development, poverty reduction, and social inclusion.
This proposed new indicator comprises two components: (i) percentage with documented or recognized evidence of tenure and (ii) percentage who perceive that their rights to land, property, or other productive resources are recognized and protected. Documentation and perception provide critical and complementary information on tenure security and resource rights. In addition, they both highlight outcomes and on-the-ground realities. The proposed focus on “documented or recognized evidence of tenure” is flexible enough to cover a range of tenure rights in different country contexts, and should include evidence of collective rights where appropriate.3 Because documentation alone, while important, is often not sufficient to gauge true tenure security, the perception measure provides valuable complementary information. In addition, the perception measure may facilitate more useful comparisons across countries.",,,,"As stated in the headline of the indicator, gender, indigenous peoples, and local communities are priority groups for disaggregation. Further disaggregation by urban/rural, region and other areas is desirable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This indicator is closely aligned with suggested indicators developed by the Global Land Indicators Initiative (GLII), a consortium of UN agencies, intergovernmental organizations, international non-governmental organizations, farmer organizations, and academics that has been working on land indicators since 2012.

Goal,,"Losses from natural disasters, by climate and non-climate-related events (in US$ and lives lost)","Vital registration for the mortality (household surveys if not available), and administrative data (national accounts and statistics) to assess economic damage and loss.",,,,"Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, are at growing risk from natural hazards, including extreme climate-related events that are projected to increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change. Population growth and urbanization will also affect vulnerability and exposure.
This indicator measures losses, both lives lost and economic costs, in urban and rural areas due to natural disasters,1 disaggregated by climate and non-climate-related events. Extreme climate-related natural disasters include the following: (i) hydro-meteorological events (storms, floods, wet mass movements) and (ii) climatological events (extreme temperature, drought, wildfire).2 Non-climate-related natural disasters consist primarily of geophysical events (earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tsunamis, dry mass movements). Other disasters that may be climate or non-climate related include biological events (epidemics, insect infestations, animal stampedes). If in doubt, we propose that the events be categorized as “non-climate related.”
Effective adaptation and disaster risk reduction measures are needed to reduce the economic and social impact of natural disasters, including extreme climate events, on agriculture and rural areas. The economic dimensions of this indicator would track crop and animal production losses associated with climate and non-climate-related events, primarily through utilizing real-time remote sensing technology as the core of high-resolution agricultural monitoring systems. Such an indicator would also track the success of adaptation and other preparedness measures in areas that are most at risk, including, for example, the adoption of new stress tolerant varieties or other resilience-enhancing technologies that minimize the risk of crop losses.3
Other economic loss dimensions should be considered, including damage at the replacement value of totally or partially destroyed physical assets; losses in the flows of the economy that arise from the temporary absence of the damaged assets; resultant impact on post-disaster macroeconomic performance, with special reference to economic growth/GDP, the balance of payments and fiscal situation of the Government; as per the Damage and Loss Assessment Methodology developed by UN- ECLAC.4
Human losses would be measured by the number of persons deceased or missing as a direct result of the natural disaster, confirmed using official figures. The scale and duration of displacement would also be an important aspect of the human cost.",,,,"This indicator can be disaggregated spatially (including urban/rural) and by the age and sex of those killed. Further opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed, including the socio- economic profile of those impacted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Some biological disasters (epidemics, insect infestations, animal stampedes) can be climate-related. The indicator would need to specify clearly which of these events are considered climate-related.
It should also be noted that there are some limitations around measuring the scale of disaster losses recorded. For example, the CRED’s International Disasters Database (EM-DAT) has a lower-end threshold for recording losses than other commonly used reinsurance databases such as Swiss Re’s Sigma or Munich Re’s NatCatSERVICE. A precise threshold will need to be agreed upon.5",,,,,,
Goal,,Total fertility rate,Civil registration and vital statistics.,,,,"The total fertility rate is the average number of live births a woman would have by age 50 if she were subject, throughout her life, to the age-specific fertility rates observed in a given year. The calculation assumes that there is no maternal mortality. Falling total fertility rates may demonstrate an improvement in women’s ability to exercise their right to make informed and free choices over if, when, and how many children they would like to have.
A deep technical literature shows that high fertility rates are inversely related to the incidence of extreme poverty and per capita economic growth, gender inequality, maternal mortality and poor child health, environmental degradation, and other dimensions of sustainable development.1 Paragraph 13 of the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) highlights also that reducing population growth through voluntary transition to lower fertility levels is one component of achieving sustainable development.2",,,,By age and rural/urban.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To be reviewed.,,,,,,
Goal,,Proportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy consumption (MDG Indicator),"This indicator is based on a combination of national food balances (administrative data), population data (census), and household consumption (household surveys).",,,,"The percentage of the population below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption is defined as the percentage of people in a population who suffer from hunger or food deprivation (caloric). This MDG Indicator collected by FAO is expressed as a percentage, and it is based on the following three parameters:

The three-year moving average amount of food available for human consumption per person per day;
The level of inequality in access to that food; and
The minimum dietary energy required for an average person– expressed in kilocalories per day.
",,,,"This indicator measures an important aspect of the food insecurity of a population. In assessing food insecurity, it is important to consider geographical areas that may be particularly vulnerable (such as areas with a high probability of major variations in food production or supply) and population groups whose access to food is precarious or sporadic (such as particular ethnic or social groups). In addition, intra-household access to food may show disparities by sex. Therefore, whenever household survey food consumption data are available and disaggregated by sex, efforts should be made to conduct sex-based undernourishment analyses.1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Some experts argue that caloric intake alone is not a helpful measure of sufficient healthy food. Instead they recommend measuring dietary diversity, the percentage of calories from non-staple crops, or the share of calories from protein. An additional indicator that could be utilized is the Food Insecurity Experience Scale developed by FAO.",,,,,,
Goal,,Percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49) with anemia,Administrative data from health ministries survey reports.,,,,"Micronutrients are essential for good health, however shortfalls of one or more micronutrients are common in some regions due to diet, poverty, and/or illness.1 Micronutrient deficiencies are especially devastating to pregnant women and children, as deficiencies during the first 1000 days can have lifelong affects on physical, mental, and emotional development. Anemia is a multi- factorial disorder caused mainly by iron deficiency and infections and to a lesser extent by deficiencies of vitamin A, vitamin B12, folate, and riboflavin. Anemia affects half a billion women worldwide, or about 29% of non-pregnant women and 38% of pregnant women, mostly in South Asia and Central and West Africa. It is estimated that half the cases of anemia are due to iron deficiency.2  Anemia in women of reproductive age serves as a proxy for micronutrient deficiencies in the absence of more comprehensive indicators. Data on anemia prevalence collected in 1993-2005 are available for 73% of non-pregnant women of reproductive age, in 82 countries, (WHO 2012).",,,,"Disaggregated by age, socioeconomic status, rural/urban, and ethnicity or indigenous status.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tracking anemia in women of reproductive age accurately measures the risk of micronutrient deficiency to the most vulnerable (the developing fetus), but is not a perfect proxy for status of all micronutrients across all populations and sub-populations. Ideally, countries would track deficiencies of iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin A, folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin D across all ages, genders, and other socioeconomic gradients. This would give a more robust portrait of the nutritional state of a country. Today it would be challenging to implement such an indicator, but the development of rapid diagnostic tests for micronutrient deficiency could make this feasible before the end of the SDG period. In fact, some countries are already collecting data on iron, iodine, vitamin A, folate, and vitamin B12 at a national level.3",,,,,,
Goal,, Prevalence of stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of age,Household survey and/or administrative data from health records.,,,,"This indicator will measure children under age 5 who exhibit stunting and wasting. The indicator will track children who are a) neither stunted nor wasted, b) stunted but not wasted, c) wasted but not stunted, and c) both wasted and stunted, as interventions differ for the two conditions. This will provide an accurate picture of under-5 nutrition. Proper nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life is vital for children to reach their full potential. Stunting and wasting in children can have severe and potentially irreversible impacts on their physical, mental, and emotional development.
Stunting is low height for age; the indicator measures children age 5 years and under whose height for age is two or more standard deviations below the median height for age of a reference population. Stunting is caused by chronic nutrient deficiency and/or illness.
Wasting is low weight for age; the indicator measures children age 5 years and under whose weight for age is two or more standard deviations below the median weight for age of a reference population. Wasting is caused by acute food shortages and/or disease, and is strongly correlated with under-5 mortality.",,,,"This indicator can be disaggregated by sex, age, household income, and other socioeconomic and spatial qualifiers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When monitoring in the MDG annual report, UNICEF includes data on underweight, stunting, and wasting.

Breastfed children have at least a six-times greater chance of survival in the early months than non- breastfed children. An exclusively breastfed child is 14 times less likely to die in the first six months of life than a non-breastfed child, and breastfeeding drastically reduces deaths from acute respiratory infection and diarrhea, two major child killers.2 The potential impact of optimal breastfeeding practices is especially important in developing country situations with a high burden of disease and low access to clean water and sanitation. Exclusive breastfeeding also has a protective effect against obesity and certain non-communicable diseases later in life.3

Lack of dietary diversity has been shown to be a crucial issue, particularly in the developing world where diets consist mainly of starchy staples with less access to nutrient-rich sources of food such as animal protein, fruits and vegetables. Women and children are particularly vulnerable to ill effects.
This indicator tracks dietary diversity, a vital element of diet quality, by measuring the consumption of a variety of foods across and within food groups, and across different varieties of specific foods, to ensure adequate intake of essential nutrients and important non-nutrient factors. Research has demonstrated a strong association between dietary diversity and diet quality, and nutritional status of children.1 It is also clear that household dietary diversity is a sound predictor of the micronutrient density of the diet, particularly for young children.2 Studies have also shown that dietary diversity is associated with food security and socioeconomic status, and links between socioeconomic factors and nutrition outcomes are well known.3
Based on surveys, the indicator measures consumption of at least five of ten food groups: starchy foods; beans and peas; nuts and seeds; dairy; flesh foods; eggs; vitamin A-rich dark green leafy vegetables; other vitamin A-rich vegetables and fruits; other vegetables; and other fruits. The FAO, the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance III Project (FANTA), and many other stakeholders have endorsed this indicator (under the name “Minimum Dietary Diversity – Women (MDD-W)”). This indicator helps practitioners set nutrition targets for women, advocate for healthier diets, and assess consumption patterns in order to improve women’s nutrition.4",,,,"This indicator can be disaggregated by age, household income, education, and urban/rural.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The MDD-W has been piloted in several countries through household surveys (DHS) and individual research projects with the aim of widespread application as a global indicator by 2017; however, additional work will be needed to take this indicator to the global level. Further, while this indicator can be a useful proxy for diet quality of young children and women of reproductive age living in poverty in low-income countries, it does not take into account other aspects of diet that have been related to risk of NCDs, such as the adverse effects of refined starches, sugar, red meat, and trans fat, and might actually encourage over consumption of some unhealthy foods in other populations and demographic groups. Further, encouragement of higher consumption of some forms of animal flesh, especially beef and dairy products, could have adverse effects on sustainability if applied globally to all demographic groups.
To accurately understand and improve dietary quality worldwide, we need to begin to collect far more data on individual diets. Currently, many countries do not routinely collect dietary data, and those that do often do not capture robust data at the needed spatial and time scales. Further, new indicators of dietary quality should be developed that predict optimal health across the life cycle. Finally, a major weakness of this indicator is that it does not capture the nutritional status of an entire population. As data systems improve and we are able to collect high-quality dietary data in near real-time, diet quality indicators should be expanded to cover women and men starting at 6 months and going up to at least age 70.",,,,,,

This indicator is a benchmark for productivity that shows the exploitable yield gap. Countries could aim, for example, for the majority of their farms to achieve at least 80% of the attainable water-limited yield potential on a sustainable basis, which requires implementing the right policy and technology roadmaps.",,,,"It can be disaggregated by crops of highest priority for a country and is suitable for spatial disaggregation, from local to global scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This indicator must be interpreted in conjunction with other indicators expressing efficiency of critical resources, such as water and nutrients, to ensure agro-ecologically sustainable solutions.

First, the indicator does not distinguish between levels of training of extension workers. It should only include professionals with a minimum level of education, training, and certification. Second, the indicator does not measure the effectiveness of the agricultural extension system in terms of actually reaching farmers with new information, knowledge and services. Therefore, an additional indicator could be developed to measure the percentage of farmers who are effectively and regularly covered by quality agricultural extension or similar programs.",,,,,,
Goal,, Nitrogen use efficiency in food systems,TBD.,,,,"Nitrogen plays a central role for the productivity, sustainability and environmental impact of crop and animal production systems. Nitrogen is essential for feeding the world’s population and to enable intensive farming, which in turn limits the conversion of land to agriculture.
Most of the anthropogenic nitrogen produced enters global cycles as fertilizer in crop production. Hence, optimizing nitrogen management so that high yields can be achieved with high nitrogen fertilizer efficiency is a core component of food security as well as environmental sustainability. At the same time, some food systems (e.g. smallholder food production in sub-Saharan Africa) consume more nitrogen than is replenished – they “mine” nitrogen from soils. An effective nitrogen indicator therefore needs to track the levels as well as efficiency of nitrogen use.
Nitrogen use efficiency is based on the mass balance principle and defined as nitrogen output in harvested products divided by the nitrogen inputs to the farm or the food system. It must be corrected for changes in the stock of nitrogen inside the system.
The indicator can be presented graphically by mapping nitrogen input against nitrogen output. For each food system and agro-ecological area, optimal ranges of nitrogen use efficiency can be defined, which in turn makes it possible to determine whether a given system uses nitrogen optimally or has too low/high nitrogen use efficiency. Additionally, the presentation of the indicator can identify minimum nitrogen use levels that denote minimum food production thresholds. Food systems, such as many smallholder farmers in Africa, that use too little nitrogen would therefore be encouraged to increase nitrogen use. Finally, the graphs can specify the acceptable nitrogen balance surplus for each food system.
Such a graph is illustrated schematically below (Figure 7). All values are purely indicative and for illustration purposes only.
Figure 7: Example for acceptable boundaries of nitrogen output/input ratios, nitrogen use efficiency, minimum productivity levels, and maximum nitrogen surplus balance at a national scale. The example only serves to illustrate the interpretation of the proposed indicator.94
[graphic]
Targets for crop nitrogen use efficiency are context-specific, primarily depending on climate, yield, current nitrogen use, soil quality, irrigation, and other crop management practices. This indicator needs to be interpreted in relation to other indicators, such as the crop yield gap indicator and the water productivity indicator. A possible target range for this indicator would require careful consideration.
Tracking nitrogen will require major improvements of the necessary data collection systems in two ways: (i) annual nutrient use and crop removal statistics at sub-national level and by crops (fertilizers and other nutrient sources) and (ii) regular field monitoring of nitrogen use efficiency and other nutrient-related indicators (e.g. soil fertility, management practices for better nutrient stewardship).
Currently this indicator is not used widely. It has recently been recommended by a task force of the UNEP Global Partnership on Nutrient Management (GPNM), the EU Nitrogen Experts Panel, and other expert groups.",,,,"Food production systems are extremely diverse and context specific. Therefore it is important that nitrogen indicators can be tracked at different geographic scales (local, national, global) as well as by farming systems (e.g. maize, wheat, cassava). Nitrogen use efficiency can be estimated at different scales. Countries can track it for each major farming system, agroecological zone, and/or watershed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This indicator tracks only nitrogen use and is complemented by a national indicator for phosphorus. We believe that nitrogen and phosphorus are the two most important nutrients to track, but we underscore that sustainable food systems will require sound management of many other nutrients, including potassium and soil organic matter.",,,,,,
Goal,, [Crop water productivity (tons of harvested product per unit irrigation water)] – to be developed,TBD.,,,,The proposed indicator is directly related to freshwater use for irrigation.

This indicator reflects the capacity of health systems to effectively prevent and address the complications occurring during pregnancy and childbirth. It may also highlight inadequate nutrition and general health of women and reflect the lack of fulfillment of their reproductive rights resulting in repeated and poorly spaced pregnancies.
The maternal mortality rate is the number of maternal deaths in a population divided by the number of women of reproductive age. It captures the likelihood of both becoming pregnant and dying during pregnancy (including deaths up to six weeks after delivery).",,,,"As data systems improve, it will be important to disaggregate by age, geographic location (e.g. urban vs. rural), and income level.1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Both metrics are difficult to measure as vital registration and health information systems are often weak in developing countries.

This tracks progress towards reducing HIV infection and improving access to treatment. Treatment describes the percent of people living with HIV who are receiving ART, which consists of the use of at least three antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to maximally suppress HIV and stop the progression of the disease. It adds tracking of mortality from HIV/AIDS. The mortality rate is the estimated number of people that have died due to HIV as a ratio to people living with HIV.",,,,"By sex, age and urban/rural.

Goal,," [Consultations with a licensed provider in a health facility or the community per person, per year] – to be developed",TBD.,,,,"Access to primary health care services, including emergency obstetric care (EmOC), is necessary for achieving the health targets.1 Primary health services are defined broadly to include preventative, curative, and palliative care of communicable and non-communicable diseases, sexual and reproductive health services, family planning, routine immunizations, and mental health. All of these elements are equally important to ensure good health and wellbeing.
The proposed indicator tracks the average number of consultations – including preventative and curative services – with a licensed provider. Licensed providers in health facilities include all adequately trained personnel registered and integrated in a national health system. Countries will set their own definitions of “licensed;” however, definitions should include consultations with community health workers (CHWs) but exclude pharmacists.
There is agreement in the academic community that this is currently the most feasible and robust indicator on access to and utilization of services. WHO recommends a target for this indicator.2 Through disaggregation, this indicator can provide insight into the causes of lack of access. Disaggregation by wealth quintile reveals areas where high costs prohibit access for the poorest people, and disaggregation by region or province can reveal areas where the number of health facilities or the number of health workers are inadequate.
The WHO and the World Bank are jointly working to develop a more robust and sophisticated indicator on access to health services. Such an indicator could replace this formulation.",,,,"By sex, income, and region. Further opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data availability may be a limiting factor for applying this indicator in rural areas and some low-income countries, especially when tracking visits with CHWs. Yet, modern information and communication technologies make it possible to collect such data effectively and at low cost. Since the same data can be used to assess the performance of a health system and its various facilities, its collection should be encouraged.
A second limitation of the indicator is that it measures the average number of consultations across an entire population. Such averages do not give information on how many people are excluded from the health system for some or all types of consultations unless disaggregated by a wide variety of factors.
Alternative measures for access to health care services are expressed as “percent of population living within [x] kilometers of service delivery point.” A service delivery point is typically defined as any location where a licensed provider (including CHWs but excluding pharmacists) provides services. In the case of EmOC facilities, WHO defines the acceptable level of access as five facilities (including at least one comprehensive facility) for every 500,000 population. The difficulty with such geospatial indicators is that they do not adequately capture utilization and access, which may be conditioned by factors beyond physical proximity and affordability.",,,,,,

It is critical that global efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and promote social inclusion are not undermined by impoverishing expenditure to use needed health services, and that the poorest people can afford critical care.1 For this reason, a monitoring framework for the SDGs must include a Global Monitoring Indicator on financial protection for health care.
Yet, measuring financial affordability and protection for a broad range of health services is difficult. An indicator for financial affordability and protection requires accurate data from a number of sources, including public health financing rules and household surveys. Data availability should be good in countries implementing universal health care (UHC), but may be a challenge in other countries.
Below we describe the two best options for this indicator and outline major limitations. We believe that these limitations can be overcome, but for now we present a placeholder for this indicator. The WHO and the World Bank are jointly working to develop a more robust and sophisticated indicator on financial protection. The SDSN looks forward to working with them and other interested organizations to identify the appropriate indicator and to promote it as part of the indicator framework for the SDGs.
The two best available options for a Global Monitoring Indicator on financial protection are:

The percentage of households experiencing catastrophic health expenditure (usually defined as a share of annual household income net of subsistence needs)
The number of households falling below the poverty line or being pushed deeper into poverty due to out-of-pocket spending on health care

These indicators can also be framed in reverse, e.g. the share of the population that does not experience catastrophic health expenditure.
A recent report by the WHO and the World Bank recommends these two indicators,2 and data availability has improved in recent years so that either indicator can be computed for a large number of countries. However, these indicators do not adequately measure the common and often deadly condition of an already impoverished household that simply cannot access health services because of cost.3 These indicators are therefore likely vulnerable to under-counting. Moreover, the indicators do not provide a clear indication of the impact that out-of-pocket health expenditure might have on the overall social and economic situation of households.
It is also possible to evaluate the financial protection of health care systems in more synthetic ways, based on the rules of public financing for outpatient services, inpatient care, laboratory services, and medicines. Systems with full public financing will score high; those with heavy co-payments or out-of- pocket payments will score low. These synthetic calculations can be made annually based on health care rules and can be cross-checked and validated by comparison with the share of out-of-pocket outlays and by survey questions (e.g. “Were you and family members unable to access needed health services or medicines because of lack of family income?”).",,,,By sex and wealth quintile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To be determined once the indicator has been specified.,,,,,,
Goal,," Proportion of persons with a severe mental disorder (psychosis, bipolar affective disorder, or moderate-severe depression) who are using services","One option is to collect data on both the numerator and the denominator as part of routine population surveys, such as DHS surveys.4 Alternatively, data for the numerator can be collected from hospital and clinic administrative records, while data for the denominator can be based on national or sub-national prevalence rates. National prevalence rates of psychosis, bipolar affective disorder, and moderate-severe depression are estimated annually as part of the global burden of disease study for all countries.5",,,,"There is growing recognition of the need for comprehensive mental health services to be offered as part of a universal health care (UHC) package. The World Health Organization’s Mental Health Action Plan proposes a number of indicators on mental health, including this indicator, which measures service coverage for a selected set of severe mental disorders.1 This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of cases of severe mental disorders (psychoses, bipolar affective disorder, or moderate-severe depression) receiving services by the total number of cases of severe mental disorder in the sampled population.2",,,,By sex and geographical location like rural and urban (to support targeting of healthcare systems). Other opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There have been a number of conferences and meetings discussing mental health in the post-2015 development agenda;3 these groups should aim to build consensus around an appropriate target range for this indicator, which has yet to be determined. In addition, stigma against people suffering from severe mental disorders may lead to under-counting. Data collected from surveys and hospital administrative records should be compared against prevalence estimates to reduce under- counting.",,,,,,
Goal,, Contraceptive prevalence rate (MDG Indicator),"Household surveys – some key surveys that include this information are: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) conducted with assistance from the US CDC, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and other national surveys.",,,,"The contraceptive prevalence rate is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age who use (or whose partners use) a contraceptive method at a given point in time. Women ‘of reproductive age’ is usually defined as women aged 15 to 49, but sexually active adolescents under 15 should be included. Increased contraceptive prevalence is also an important proximate determinant of inter-country differences in fertility and of ongoing fertility declines in developing countries. Contraceptive prevalence is influenced by people’s fertility desires, availability of high-quality products and services; social norms and values; levels of education; and other factors, such as marriage patterns and traditional birth-spacing practices. It is an indicator of population and health, particularly women’s access to reproductive health services. The level of contraceptive use has a strong, direct effect on the total fertility rate (TFR) and, through the TFR, on the rate of population growth. It also serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services that are essential for meeting many health targets, especially the targets related to child mortality, maternal health, HIV/AIDS, and gender equality.1",,,,"By age, urban/rural and marital status.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Common limitations to this indicator include under-monitoring and underestimation of overall use, vague time references, and insufficient accuracy.",,,,,,
Goal,, Current use of any tobacco product (age-standardized rate),Household surveys.,,,,"Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death in many developed countries, and is a growing problem and contributor to the burden of disease in developing countries. This indicator measures the prevalence of tobacco use (daily, non-daily, or occasional) of any tobacco product, including cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, pipes, snuff, chew, etc., for adults aged 15 years and over.1 It expands upon the WHO’s recommendation to further track use of smokeless tobacco products. The age-standardized prevalence rate of tobacco use (adjusted according to the WHO regression method) allows for comparisons across countries and across time periods to determine trends.2",,,,"By sex, age and urban/rural.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To be reviewed.,,,,,,
Goal,, Percentage of children (36-59 months) receiving at least one year of a quality pre-primary education program,"Household surveys, including the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).",,,,"This indicator measures the percentage of children in the 36-59 months age group that are enrolled in an early childhood program. Programs can be defined fairly broadly ranging from private or community care to formal pre-school programs.
This is an important indicator for measuring child development. Exposure to at least a year of high- quality pre-primary education has consistent and positive short-term and long-term effects on children’s development. In the short run, early cognitive skills, including reading and math skills, are positively affected by pre-primary education. In low- and middle-income countries, access to quality pre-primary education increases the share of students who enter primary school on time. High-quality preschool can produce lifelong benefits for society, with positive effects observed on years of completed schooling, secondary school completion, reduced crime, reduced early pregnancy, and increased earnings. These results encompass both small-scale demonstrations and large-scale programs, and are responsible for the impressive benefit-cost ratios for preschool (6 or larger, across high-, middle-, and low-income countries). Pre-primary education benefits all children, no matter their economic background, yet as with many other ECD services, those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds benefit the most.1",,,,"By sex, location, and household income.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The indicator is less helpful in measuring the quality of pre-primary education care. Quality standards of structure (safety, access to clean water, small group sizes, etc.) and process (instructional and interactive skills of the teacher or caregiver) are important for children’s learning and development, but much harder to measure.",,,,,,
Goal,, Early Child Development Index (ECDI),"Household surveys, including the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).",,,,"Developmental potential in early childhood is measured as an index, currently represented in the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) that assesses children aged 36-59 months in four domains: language/literacy, numeracy, physical, socio-emotional, and cognitive development. Each of these four domains is measured through instruments based on real-time observation. The MICS surveys calculate an overall Index Score as the percentage of children aged 36-59 months who are on track in at least three of the four domains.",,,,"By sex, age and urban/rural.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A major shortcoming of this metric is that it describes a composite index. As emphasized in this report (Section III), composite indices should generally not be used for SDG monitoring purposes – particularly since they expand the number of variables that need to be considered under Global Monitoring Indicators. Moreover, it will be difficult to track the ECD Index in all countries since it relies on MICS data, which is only collected in a sub-set of countries. We therefore welcome suggestions for how the critical issue of ECD can be tracked in an indicator framework.
Other measures of caregiver- or parent-reported young child development exist or are under development, including the Early Development Instrument and the Index of Early Human Capability, which incorporate items representing each of these domains and are being used across high-, middle-, and low-income countries.1 Important complements to this form of measure are those assessments that can capture development in specific areas over time (e.g. growth in language or emotional skills).",,,,,,
Goal,, Primary completion rates for girls and boys,"Administrative data is preferred, and fairly easily available. It can be complemented with household surveys.",,,,"Primary completion is measured by the Gross Intake Ratio, which is the total number of new entrants who reach the last grade of primary education (according to the International Standard Classification of Education or ISCED 20111), regardless of age, expressed as percentage of the total population of the theoretical entrance age to the last grade of primary. Primary education is defined by ISCED 2011 as programs typically designed on a unit or project basis to provide pupils with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects such as history, geography, natural science, social science, art, and music.
The Gross Intake Ratio to Last Grade of primary reports on the current primary access to last grade, stemming from previous years’ of schooling and past education policies on entrance to primary education. It is a measure of first-time completion of primary education as it excludes pupils repeating the last grade. A high Gross Intake Ratio to Last Grade denotes a high degree of completion of primary education. As this calculation includes all new entrants to last grade (regardless of age), the Gross Intake Ratio may exceed 100%, due to over-aged or under-aged pupils entering the last grade of primary school for the first time.2",,,,"It is particularly important to disaggregate data for this indicator by sex, income, disability, region, and household income quintile, with particular attention to children in regions of conflict, since children in such regions are at greatest risk of dropping out of the schooling system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Since the primary completion rate is typically a lagging rather than leading indicator when looking at factors affecting entry to school, it will be important to find other ways to measure progress on entry barriers.",,,,,,
Goal,," [Percentage of girls and boys who master a broad range of foundational skills, including in literacy and mathematics by the end of the primary school cycle (based on credibly established national benchmarks)] – to be developed","Administrative data, or school-based or citizen led learning assessments.",,,,"This indicator is designed to measure the proportion of children who are proficient in reading and comprehending text in their primary language of instruction and those that are able to, at the very least, count and understand core mathematical operations and concepts, as a proportion of total children at the end of the primary schooling cycle in the country. Proficiency will need to be defined at the national level, but should cover the ability to read, decode, comprehend and analyze text in their primary language of instruction. This is a new aggregate indicator proposed to ensure such proficiency can be captured, as can the learning of basic mathematical skills that are known to have strong links with future academic performance.",,,,By sex and urban/rural.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Since 2005, over 60 developing countries have used some measure of reading or have participated in internationally comparable assessments of reading comprehension. There are no global standards for defining “proficiency in reading” primarily because of differences in language, curriculum design, and pedagogical approaches. However, it is recommended that each country adopts and/or defines a core set of standards that can be assessed either through school-based or household-based assessments. Several countries have national standards of foundational numeracy skills that are identified in national curricula frameworks. It is further recommended that each country adopts and/or defines foundational numeracy skills standards that, while being locally relevant, are referenced in some way to international benchmarks. It is particularly important that foundational numeracy skills are comparable to global standards since these skills are relevant across countries and can form the basis for future global competitiveness of the country’s labor force.
The need to have measures of reading and mathematical skills has been stressed by various global initiatives including the Learning Metrics Task Force (which recommends such skills be measured at grade 3).1 This new indicator should build on the experiences of existing programs, including the Monitoring of Learning Achievement (MLA), Program on the Assessment of Student Achievement (PASA), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SAQMEQ), the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).
This indicator should not be restricted to measurement of reading and mathematics; as countries develop comparable indicators for other domains of learning (physical wellbeing, social and emotional skills, culture and arts, literacy and communications, learning approaches and cognition, and science and technology), it is recommended that these indicators be tracked in a composite measure at the end of the primary school cycle. We support the ongoing efforts of the Learning Metrics Task Force to develop the indicators to track these areas globally. We also support ongoing efforts by the Task Force, UNESCO, UNICEF and other organizations in developing international benchmarks for these indicators, recognizing the variation of education systems and contexts across countries.",,,,,,
Goal,, Secondary completion rates for girls and boys,"Administrative data is preferred, but when there is limited data availability, it can be complemented with household surveys.",,,,"Secondary completion is computed by dividing the total number of students in the last grade of secondary education school minus repeaters in that grade by the total number of children of official completing age. It captures dropout rates within secondary school as well as the transition rate between primary to secondary schooling by using as its denominator the total number of children of official completing age.
Secondary completion rates are important to measure since the dropout rates are highest in lower secondary grades. These are the ages when both the actual cost and the opportunity cost of education become higher, and when education systems struggle to provide high-quality instruction. There may be gender differences, as willingness to school girls is far more strongly determined by income and the broader costs of education than is the case for boys, and families are often unwilling to invest in the education of girls if this investment will not bring equivalent and direct economic gains to them and if girls continue to be valued only as wives and mothers.",,,,"It is particularly important to disaggregate this indicator by sex, income, disability, region, and separately for children in regions of conflict, since children in such regions are at greatest risk of dropping out of the schooling system. Where administrative data does not capture this information, it may be important to capture it under such categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Secondary completion rates are more difficult to compare across countries since the structure of schooling varies widely, and the relevant age groups differ accordingly. Further, students at the secondary level have access to alternate pathways through vocational or other non- formal programs, so global comparison is harder. Secondary completion rates therefore can only be calculated on a national basis with reference to the number of years of schooling of that particular country. They are not easily comparable across countries. Yet it is an important indicator of the reach of the education system and therefore included as a global indicator.",,,,,,
Goal,," [Percentage of girls and boys who achieve proficiency across a broad range of learning outcomes, including in literacy and in mathematics by end of lower secondary schooling cycle (based on credibly established national benchmarks)] – to be developed","Administrative data, or school-based or citizen led learning assessments.",,,,"The indicator measures the percentage of girls and boys who are “proficient” in broad learning outcomes, and at a minimum in reading and in mathematics. Proficiency will need to be defined through national level standards, but should cover the ability to read, decode, comprehend, and analyze text in the primary language of instruction, and to understand advanced mathematical concepts, reason, and resolve complex problems.
While the mathematics measure is easier to compare across countries, each country will need to identify its own set of standards for proficiency. It is recommended that there be a serious effort to benchmark national standards against comparable international standards where they exist. It is also recommended that this indicator be measured through either school-based or household-based assessments annually to track progress of the education system. The fundamental danger of skills-based indicators is that such indicators can only capture a small slice of the range of competencies that students are expected to acquire; assessing a subset can often focus education systems too exclusively on that subset, thereby leading to neglect of the broader set of competencies. This indicator is intended to measure the baseline or minimum set of skills expected of students at the end of the lower secondary schooling cycle. A broader indicator should be designed to ensure that other competencies are not neglected.",,,,Opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed once the indicator has been defined.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Proficiency standards do not exist systematically within countries; we recommend that countries identify/adopt a core set of standards that are designed with reference to global standards, where they exist.

Tertiary education is defined as per the International Standard Classification of Education (1997) levels 5 and 6.
Tertiary enrollment rates are indicative of the quality of the labor force in the country, and a wide gap between the tertiary enrollment rates and unemployment rates indicate either an inability of the economy to absorb its trained graduates, or the “employability” of the graduates which indicates a mismatch between the skills being imparted through the tertiary education system and the skills demanded by the market.",,,,"Share of enrollment by sex, urban/rural and by field of study (to track women in science, mathematics, engineering, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tertiary enrollment rates by themselves are not predictors of youth unemployment rates.,,,,,,
Goal,, Prevalence of girls and women 15-49 who have experienced physical or sexual violence [by an intimate partner] in the last 12 months,Household surveys.,,,,"Violence against women and girls is important not only because of the moral or public health issues it raises, but also since the threat of ‘domestic’ violence keeps women in the home and further constrains women’s movements and actions, limiting their life choices. The Global Burden of Disease estimates that over 30% of all girls and women aged 15 and older suffer physical or sexual partner abuse during their lifetime. Knowing the incidence and prevalence of violence is a first step to ensuring adequate prevention policies.
This indicator measures the occurrence of violence against girls and women by intimate partners. Violence is defined as physical and/or sexual violence and the threat of such violence. Since most violence against women is perpetrated by their husband or intimate partner, this measure captures most incidences of violence against women. The 12-month measure of partner violence is better suited than a lifetime measure, to reveal changes in levels and risks of violence over time.",,,,"By frequency, age, marital status, urban/rural, and type of and severity of violence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Measures of partner violence in high-income countries would need to be re- calculated to conform to the data available globally.

Goal,, Percentage of referred cases of sexual and gender-based violence against women and children that are investigated and sentenced,Administrative data.,,,,"Sexual and gender-based violence remains widespread, and too often ends in impunity. This indicator, recommended as a measure under UNSCR 1325 on women and peace and security, assesses how the police and justice system process and manage violence against women and children. The three stages – monitoring, investigating, and sentencing – are all important and interrelated. Monitoring suggests confidence in the system, investigation shows commitment by the police/legal establishment, and sentencing shows justice being achieved.
This indicator is also a good proxy for a broader measure of the quality of the rule of law and access to justice in a given country. In order to know whether a justice system is performing, several aspects must be measured: the capacity to redress crimes, whether citizens trust formal systems enough to actually go to police and courts, and the rates of redress.

It calls attention to inequities in service access and is therefore used to promote a human rights-based approach to reproductive health.”1 Women have the right to determine whether or not to have children, as well as the number and spacing of their pregnancies, and family planning is a key dimension of access to reproductive health.

Goal,," Percentage of population using safely managed water services, by urban/rural (modified MDG Indicator)",Household surveys and administrative data.,,,,"This indicator measures the percentage of the urban and rural population using safely managed drinking water services, as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. This ambitious indicator goes beyond the previous “basic drinking water” indicator as it has been designed to incorporate an assessment of the quality and safety of the water people use.
Households are considered to have access to safely managed drinking water service when they use water from a basic source on premises. The term ‘safely managed’ is proposed to describe a higher threshold of service; for water, this includes measures for protecting supplies and ensuring water is safe to drink.1
Lack of safe drinking water is a major cause of illness and mortality, as a result of exposure to infectious agents, chemical pollutants, and poor hygiene. Inadequate access to water in the home is also a source of economic disadvantage by requiring large commitment of human resources to fetching and carrying water.2
A basic drinking water source is a source or delivery point that by nature of its construction or through active intervention is protected from outside contamination with fecal matter. Basic drinking water sources can include: piped drinking water supply on premises; public taps/stand posts; tube well/borehole; protected dug well; protected spring; rainwater; and bottled water (when another basic source is used for hand washing, cooking, or other basic personal hygiene purposes).3",,,,By urban/rural. Further opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The monitoring methodology for this indicator is ready and being piloted in several countries. Where the data is unavailable, we suggest that countries may, on an interim basis, continue to use the “basic drinking water” indictor, defined as the percentage of population using a basic source with a total collection time of 30 minutes or less for a round trip including queuing.
Since this indicator is quite ambitious and the objective is the progressive elimination of inequalities in access, an intermediary indicator to measure universal basic access by 2030 could be “Percentage of population using basic safe water.”

Goal,," Percentage of population using safely managed sanitation services, by urban/rural (modified MDG Indicator)",Household surveys and administrative data.,,,,"The indicator measures the percentage of the population in urban and rural areas using safely managed sanitation services, as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. This ambitious indicator goes beyond the pre-2015 “improved sanitation” indicator.
Safely managed sanitation services are those that effectively separate excreta from human contact, and ensure that excreta do not re-enter the immediate environment. This means that household excreta are contained, extracted, and transported to designated disposal or treatment site, or, as locally appropriate, are safely re-used at the household or community level. Each of the following types of facilities are considered adequate if the facility is not shared with other households: a pit latrine with a superstructure, and a platform or squatting slab constructed of durable material (composting latrines, pour-flush latrines, etc.); a toilet connected to a septic tank; or a toilet connected to a sewer network (small bore or conventional).1
Access to adequate excreta disposal facilities is fundamental to decrease the fecal risk and the frequency of associated diseases. The use of basic sanitation facilities reduces diarrhea-related morbidity in young children and also helps accelerate economic and social development in countries where poor sanitation is a major cause for missed work and school days because of illness. Its association with other socioeconomic characteristics (education, income) and its contribution to general hygiene and quality of life also make it a good universal indicator of human development.2",,,,By urban/rural.

Goal,, Percentage of wastewater flows treated to national standards [and reused] – to be developed,B,,,,"Lack of treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater presents a serious health and environmental hazard in many cities, particularly in developing countries where 80-90% of urban wastewater is untreated or insufficiently treated when discharged.1 Even in developed countries wastewater is not universally treated. Global rates of wastewater generation are increasing at an exponential rate as a result of rapid population growth and urbanization. A huge volume of untreated wastewater is dumped directly into water sources, threatening human health, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security, and the sustainability of water resources.2
For this reason we propose that an indicator on wastewater treatment be added to the post-2015 monitoring framework. There are many ways to define wastewater. Broadly defined, wastewater is a combination of one or more of: domestic effluent consisting of blackwater (excreta, urine and fecal sludge) and greywater (kitchen and bathing wastewater); water from commercial establishments and institutions, including hospitals; industrial effluent, storm water and other urban run-off; agricultural, horticultural and aquaculture effluent, either dissolved or as suspended matter.3
Wastewater treatment is the process of removing suspended and dissolved physical, chemical, and biological contaminants to produce (a) water that is safe to be discharged to the environment or suitable for reuse and (b) a solid sludge suitable for disposal or reuse (e.g. as fertilizer). Using advanced technology, it is now possible to re-use water after treatment for agricultural purposes, industry, or even as drinking water.4",,,,"By source, including domestic, commercial, and industrial effluents, and storm water runoff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The global community has only recently started working to build a common vision on wastewater management.

This indicator does not measure progress towards the important issue of increasing water-use efficiency. Public policies must try to address water stress and manage water resources sustainably, while satisfying all different demands.",,,,,,
Goal,," Share of the population using modern cooking solutions, by urban/rural",Household surveys.,,,,"This indicator measures the share of the population relying primarily on non- solid fossil fuels for cooking, as defined by the Sustainable Energy For All (SE4All) Framework Report.1 Currently available databases (including the WHO’s Global Household Energy Database, and the IEA World Energy Statistics and Balances) only support binary tracking of access (that is a household either has, or does not have access). This is why, as a starting point, the SE4All global tracking framework is using this simple definition of access to modern cooking solutions. While the binary approach serves the immediate needs of global tracking, there is a growing consensus that measurement of access should reflect a continuum of improvement, as recognized in the SE4All report.
Indeed, defining access to modern cooking solutions as the share of the population relying primarily on non-solid fossil fuels for cooking omits the role of the cook stove. Yet, it is the combination of the two that will determine levels of efficiency, pollution, and safety outcomes. Meanwhile, individual behaviors, cooking practices, and housing characteristics also affect the actual performance of a household’s cooking solutions.
For this reason, the SE4All is planning to use a multi-tier metric for tracking access to modern cooking solutions. This metric will measure access to modern cooking solutions by measuring the technical performance of the primary cooking solution (including both the fuel and the cook stove) and assessing how this solution fits in with households’ daily life. This metric also includes consideration on indoor air pollution/ventilation and kerosene cooking/lighting. Measuring access to modern cooking solutions presents the possibility to improve the health of poor households, in particular women and girls who generally have the responsibility for cooking for the household. WHO estimates that over 4 million people die prematurely from illness attributable to the household air pollution from cooking with solid fuels.2",,,,By urban/rural and sex of head of household.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To be reviewed.,,,,,,
Goal,," Share of the population using reliable electricity, by urban/rural","The SE4All, IEA and World Bank can provide data for this indicator.
WHO. Household air pollution and health Fact sheet N°292. WHO. Household air pollution and health Fact sheet N°292.",,,,"This indicator measures the share of the population with an electricity connection available at home or relying primarily on electricity for lighting, as defined by the Sustainable Energy For All (SE4All) Framework Report.1 As with access to modern cooking solutions, currently available global databases (including the World Bank’s Global Electrification Database, and the IEA World Energy Statistics and Balances) only support a binary tracking of access to electricity. This metric does not capture important dimensions of access to electricity, including:

(i) off-grid and isolated mini-grids solutions, which are required in many countries as transitional alternatives to grid-based electricity, and could potentially serve as long-term solutions in geographically remote areas;
(ii) supply problems, which are common in developing countries, where grid electricity suffers from irregular supply and frequent breakdowns;
(iii) problems of quality (such as low or fluctuating voltage); and
(iv) the difference between electricity supply and electricity services, which implies the ownership of the appropriate electrical appliance and the actual use of electricity.

For these reasons, SE4All is planning to use a multi-tier metric for measuring access to electricity. This metric will measure the degree of access to electricity supply along various dimensions, including quantity (peak available capacity), duration, evening supply, affordability, legality, and quality. This is complemented by a parallel multi-tier framework that captures the use of key electricity services.2",,,,By urban/rural and sex of head of household.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To be reviewed.,,,,,,
Goal,, Implicit incentives for low-carbon energy in the electricity sector (measured as US$/MWh or US$ per ton avoided CO2),Administrative data.,,,,"To reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the socially optimal level, the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions needs to be applied, which in turn requires government policies to apply carbon prices using a range of measures, including but not limited to regulation, taxes, or carbon markets. This indicator measures (in $/tCO2e) the level of effective carbon price in the electricity sector, as defined by the OECD report on effective carbon prices, as a net cost for society for each unit of GHG abatement induced.1 A similar definition was proposed by the Australian Productivity Commission report on carbon emission policies in key economies.2
Prices on carbon can be explicit, such as carbon taxes or prices of emission allowances in GHG emission trading systems, or they can be implicit, reflecting the cost to society per ton of CO2e abated as a result of any type of policy measure that have an impact on GHG emissions. Comparisons of the effective price put on carbon by policies in different sectors and countries provide valuable insights into the existence of incentives to reduce emissions and the cost-effectiveness of alternative policies to reduce greenhouse emissions, and their potential impacts on competiveness. The numerical results of this comparison should, however, be treated with caution, since there is no one carbon price equivalent that can comprehensively capture what a diverse set of policies in a given country intend to achieve, nor at what cost.
As a starting point, we propose that the post-2015 framework track the effective carbon price for electricity generation. This indicator covers a large share of GHG emissions and is methodologically easier to track since the relevant technologies are global in nature, emissions and policies are concentrated, and some information is available on a comparable basis from governments and international and other organizations.",,,,Opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We underscore that this indicator is agnostic to the type of policies pursued by governments. It does not give preference to taxes, markets or regulatory instruments. So governments retain their full flexibility for identifying and pursing the instruments that are best adapted to their context.
The methodology developed by the Australian Productivity Commission and the OECD could be used as reference. Once better methodologies are available for other emission areas, the indicator can be extended to a wider sectoral focus.
The indicator estimates costs of greenhouse gas abatement and their impact on prices without comparing them to societal benefits.",,,,,,
Goal,, Rate of primary energy intensity improvement,Administrative data.,,,,"This indicator is used as the proxy for energy efficiency, one of the pillars of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) framework. The indicator can be used to track the extent to which economic growth is decoupled from energy use – a key requirement for sustainable energy and decarbonization.
Energy efficiency is defined as the ratio between the gross consumption of energy and gross domestic product (GDP). Typically, the gross energy consumption is reported across five major sources of energy: solid fuels/biomass, oil, gas, nuclear, and renewable resources. The indicator is expressed as the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of energy intensity of GDP, measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.1",,,,By sector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Energy intensity is an imperfect proxy indicator because it is affected by external factors such as fluctuations in the volume and sectoral structure of GDP. However, there are statistical decomposition methods that allow these types of effects to be stripped out.2 Statisticians will need to specify whether the indicator is expressed as a moving average over multiple years or whether growth is reported year-on-year. Final energy intensity could be a better indicator because it is more comprehensive, but reporting is much more complex and ignores energy losses in transformation and delivery.",,,,,,
Goal,," GNI per capita (PPP, current US$ Atlas method)",Administrative data.,,,,"Gross national income measures the total earnings of the residents of an economy adjusted for the cost of living in each country (purchasing power parity, PPP). These earnings are defined as the sum of value added by all resident producers, plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output, plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. The International Comparison Program (ICP) can be used to compute purchasing power parity (PPP) adjustments. The Atlas method is a World Bank method of computing exchange rates to reduce the impact of market fluctuations in the cross-country comparison of national incomes.",,,,"Spatially (rural/urban, province/district).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As underscored in this report, GNI and GDP are important indicators, but they measure only part of the economic dimension of sustainable development. Both economic measures do not adequately capture people’s material conditions.1
We therefore recommend that they be complemented by other “beyond GDP” indicators (see also Table 1 in the report). For example, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting 2012 Central Framework will help support a wider set of indicators related to sustainable development and green growth, which aims at fostering economic growth while ensuring that natural resources continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which wellbeing relies. The environmental- economic framework makes it possible to create indicators linking poverty reduction and natural resource management. Interdependencies related to food security and nutrition should also be considered. These issues are central to pro-poor growth and social protection policies in developing countries.",,,,,,
Goal,, Country implements and reports on System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) accounts,International monitoring.,,,,"The UN Statistical Commission adopted the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) in 2012 as the first international standard for environmental-economic accounting. The SEEA brings statistics on the environment and its relationship to the economy into the core of official statistics and thereby expands the traditional System of National Accounts (SNA), which focuses on measuring economic performance. Examples of information provided by the SEEA includes the assessment of trends in the use and availability of natural resources, the extent of emissions and discharges to the environment resulting from economic activity, and the amount of economic activity undertaken for environmental purposes.1 The UN Statistical Commission will develop the monitoring templates for the SEEA Central Framework.
This indicator measures whether a country applies and reports on a national SEEA. It takes into account the fact that some elements of the SEEA may not be applicable to a particular country and that the implementation is incremental starting from selected accounts depending on policy priorities.",,,,"The presence of SEEAs is a national indicator, but SEEAs themselves are highly disaggregated (by sector of activity, environmental resource, sub-national unit, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A challenge with this indicator derives from the need to establish an institutional framework for compiling integrated data, and the statistical production processes and information management in the countries’ statistical systems.",,,,,,
Goal,," Youth employment rate, by formal and informal sector",Labor Force surveys.,,,,"The youth employment rate is the percentage of the youth labor force that is employed. Young people are defined as persons aged between 15 and 24. The labor force comprises all persons within the above age group currently available for work and actively seeking work, and the sum of those that are employed and unemployed.
To the extent possible, the youth employment rate should be reported separately for formal and informal employment. The latter is of particular importance in developing countries. The 17th International Conference of Labor Statisticians recommends that informal employment should include: (i) own-account workers (self-employed with no employees) in their own informal sector enterprises; (ii) employers (self-employed with employees) in their own informal sector enterprises; (iii) contributing family workers, irrespective of type of enterprise; (iv) members of informal producers’ cooperatives (not established as legal entities); (v) employees holding informal jobs as defined according to the employment relationship (in law or in practice, jobs not subject to national labor legislation, income taxation, social protection or entitlement to certain employment benefits (paid annual or sick leave, etc.); and (vi) own-account workers engaged in production of goods exclusively for final use by their household.1",,,,We recommend that the indicator be disaggregated by sex and urban/rural to understand the differential composition of men and women in the formal and informal sectors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A broad-based employment metric for formal and informal youth employment is preferable to standard unemployment measures that focus only on the formal sector.

Goal,," Mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, by urban/rural",Administrative data.,,,,"Broadband is a key enabling technology, and access provides economic benefits (access to the formal economy, access to regional and global markets for local entrepreneurs, and access to banking services); health benefits (linking health workers to national health systems); and promotes citizen participation in government. It is projected that within a few years the majority of the world’s population, including in sub-Saharan Africa, will have access to mobile broadband. This indicator measures the number of mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. The Broadband Commission describes broadband as: (a) always on; (b) high-capacity connectivity; and (c) enabling combined provision of multiple services simultaneously.1
The ITU definition refers to access to data communications (e.g. the Internet) at broadband downstream speeds greater than or equal to 256 Kbit/s.  This indicator must be seen in conjunction with indicator 63.",,,,"By urban/rural, sex, age.

Goal,, Index on ICT maturity,TBD.,,,,"Information and communication technologies (ICT) and other advanced technologies are critical for economic development and achieving the other SDGs.

Fixed broadband quality measured as mean downlink speed (in kilobits per second), as established through user speed tests;
Mobile broadband quality measured as the proportion of download speed test measurements with 10 Mbps downlink speed (or better);
International bandwidth capacity measured as bandwidth connected across international borders to metropolitan areas as of mid-year (expressed in megabit per second (mbps); and
Mobile broadband affordability measured as the mobile broadband prices as a percentage of per capita monthly GNI.

Each component of the index and the overall index could be normalized to values between 1 and 100.",,,,Opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed once the indicator has been developed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This indicator and indicator 62, which measures the urban and rural usage dimension of the ICT infrastructure, are strongly interlinked and must be reviewed together. Since ICT standards and associated usage evolve rapidly, any index for the quality of a country’s ICT infrastructure will need to be revised periodically – perhaps every five years. Access to data could be a limitation to developing in this index.
We underscore our general reluctance to include composite indices in the SDG monitoring framework (see Section III). However, the proposed Index on ICT maturity would depend largely on data that is not collected through NSOs and could be provided by an industry association. In this case it would not add to the statistical burden on NSOs. We welcome suggestions for alternative metrics for ICT maturity.",,,,,,
Goal,, Manufacturing value added (MVA) as percent of GDP,Administrative data.,,,,"This indicator is a measure of manufacturing output as share of a country’s economy. Manufacturing is broadly defined as the “physical or chemical transformation of materials into new products,” regardless of the process (by machines or by hand), location (factory or home), or sale method (wholesale or retail).1
The value added is the net output of the manufacturing sector, calculated after adding up all the outputs and subtracting the intermediate inputs. It is determined by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) revision 3, and calculated without deducting the depreciation of the fabricated assets, or the depletion and degradation of any natural resources.2 The indicator is expressed as a share of gross domestic product (GDP).",,,,Can be disaggregated by individual sectors (as per ISIC definitions) and by geography (urban/rural).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TBD.,,,,,,
Goal,," Total energy and industry-related GHG emissions by gas and sector, expressed as production and demand-based emissions (tCO2e)",Administrative data.,,,,"This indicator tracks total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in ton of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e), broken down by gas (including CO2, N2O, CH4, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6) and sector (including petroleum refining, electricity and heat production, manufacturing industries and construction, transport, commercial and residential buildings, fugitive emissions, as well as emissions from industrial processes) in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 guidelines for the national GHG inventory,1 and the special chapters on energy2 and industry-related emissions.3
The UNFCCC collects GHG emissions data, estimated using a production-based (sometimes also referred to as territorial-based) accounting method. Under this approach, all emissions taking place “within national territory and offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction” (as defined by IPCC 2006 guidelines for the national GHG inventory) are assigned to a country.
A complementary accounting method focuses on demand-based or consumption-based emissions. Under this approach emissions attributed to domestic final consumption and those caused by the production of its imports are attributed to a country.4 In other words GHG emissions for the importing country are augmented by the GHG content of the imports. Similarly, emissions for an exporting country are lowered.5 Demand or consumption-based emissions are estimated using international input- output tables and therefore require a more complex methodology.",,,,"By sectors and gas, as described above. The disaggregation by sector should – to the extent possible – be made consistent with systems of national accounts. It might be advisable to also report the data by International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The use of production-based emissions accounting is well established and consistent with the definition of GDP. Yet, since it omits emissions embodied in international trade, there is a growing body of literature that argues in favor of a demand-based or consumption-based accounting of emissions.

Goal,, Personnel in R&D (per million inhabitants),R&D surveys.,,,,"The fields of science, technology and innovation are key drivers of economic growth and development. Progress in these fields requires trained staff engaged in research and development (R&D).

Goal,, [Indicator on inequality at top end of income distribution: GNI share of richest 10% or Palma ratio],Household surveys.,,,,"Concerns about inequality focus on the top and bottom ends of the income distribution. Indicator 68, on “relative poverty,” tracks the bottom end of the income distribution, while this indicator monitors changes at the top end of the distribution. We see two options for such an indicator. First, countries may track the share of incomes generated by the richest 10% of the population. An alternative indicator is the increasingly popular Palma ratio, defined as the ratio of richest 10% of the population’s share of gross national income (GNI) divided by the poorest 40% of the population’s share.
The Palma ratio seeks to overcome some of the limitations of the widely used Gini Coefficient, which fails to take into account changing demographic structure (e.g. the effects of a baby boom or an aging population) and is insensitive to changes in the tails (top and bottom) of the income distribution, which is where most movement occurs.1 Furthermore, using a simple ratio, as opposed to the more complex Gini Coefficient measurement, is more intuitive for policy makers and citizens. For example, for a given, high Palma value it is clear what needs to change: to narrow the gap you raise the share of income of the poorest 40% and/or you reduce the share of the top 10%.",,,,"The income share of the top decile and the Palma ratio are formulated using household survey data relating to income and consumption (usually from World Bank PovCal / World Development Indicators). Such data can be disaggregated by income deciles in countries, allowing for comparative analyses between countries and regions. Further disaggregation by centiles, regions or groups would require complex analysis of the original household survey data, which at present may not be feasible on a national/ global scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"An important limitation of the income share of the top decile and the Palma ratio (as well as the Gini Coefficient) is that the indicators cannot be decomposed (i.e. overall inequality is related consistently to inequality among sub-groups). Furthermore, data is based on household surveys, some of which measure income and some consumption. The mix makes international comparison quite challenging, as the distribution of consumption tends to be less unequal than that of income. But since no means of adjustment (income vs. consumption) is readily acceptable, it is common practice not to adjust the surveys. To improve the quality of this data we recommend expanding the collection of pure income-based data, for example via the Luxembourg Income Study, which currently has micro-data for 40 countries.2",,,,,,
Goal,, Percentage of households with incomes below 50% of median income (“relative poverty”),"Administrative data are preferred, but household surveys can also be used.",,,,"Relative poverty is defined as the percentage of households with incomes less than half of the national median income.

If possible with the given survey methodology, ethnicity, religion, language, disability and indigenous status should also be reviewed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This indicator requires measurement of the national distribution of household income, which is only conducted once every two to three years and data becomes available with monitoring lags of up to three years.1",,,,,,
Goal,, Percentage of urban population living in slums or informal settlements (MDG Indicator),"Household surveys and citizen/community-run surveys, such as those developed by Slum Dwellers’ International and the Cities Alliance.",,,,"This indicator measures the percentage of the urban population living in slums or informal settlements, as defined by UN-Habitat.

At the country level, this percentage is calculated by taking the total number of people living in slums of all the cities of a country divided by the total population living in all the cities of the given country.1
UN-Habitat has developed a household level definition of a slum household in order to be able to use existing household-level survey and census data to identify slum dwellers among the urban population. A slum household is a household that lacks any one of the following five elements:

Access to basic water (access to sufficient amount of water for family use, at an affordable price, available to household members without being subject to extreme effort)
Access to basic sanitation (access to an excreta disposal system, either in the form of a private toilet or a public toilet shared with a reasonable number of people)
Security of tenure (evidence of documentation to prove secure tenure status or de facto or perceived protection from evictions)
Durability of housing (permanent and adequate structure in non-hazardous location)
Sufficient living area (not more than two people sharing the same room)
",,,,"By sex of head of household, age, and disability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Not all slums are the same and not all slum dwellers suffer from the same degree of deprivation. The degree of deprivation depends on how many of the five conditions that define slums are prevalent within a slum household. Approximately one-fifth of slum households live in extremely poor conditions, defined by UN-Habitat as lacking more than three basic shelter needs.2 The definition of the water and sanitation component of the index may need to be reviewed to ensure full consistency with the water supply and sanitation indicators currently under development by the WHO/UNICEF JMP (indicators 57 and 58).",,,,,,
Goal,, Percentage of people within 0.5km of public transit running at least every 20 minutes.,"Administrative data, complemented by mapping, surveys, and citizen-supplied data.",,,,"This indicator measures access to reliable public transportation, using a proxy of percentage of population within [0.5] kilometers of public transit running at least every [20] minutes.

It excludes taxis, car pools, and hired buses, which are not shared by strangers without prior arrangement.
Effective and low-cost transportation for mobility is critical for urban poverty reduction and economic development because it provides access to jobs, health care, education services, and more.

In addition, global data on urban transport systems do not exist. Although some data exists for public transport companies and individual cities, harmonized and comparable data on the world level do not yet exist.

Comments and Limitations:
The data for this indicator is free and publicly accessible. For more than five decades, the US Geological Survey/NASA Landsat data has been freely available, is frequently updated and its resolution is continually improving. The European Community’s Joint Research Center has developed the Global Human Settlement Layer, an even higher resolution land cover dataset with similar frequency and distribution practices as Landsat. Many researchers have used these technologies to measure land cover and urban expansion.2 Both measure built up area as buildings, compacted soils and impervious surfaces. WorldPop overlays demographic data on GIS maps.3 But over time, to ensure regular and sustainable collection of this data, NSOs might consider providing spatially continuous demographic data (not bounded by jurisdiction) in digital form and to integrate mapping into their official census data.

Goal,, Mean urban air pollution of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5),Remote sensing (satellite-based measurements are the most comprehensive and cost effective).,,,,"Rapid urbanization has resulted in increasing urban air pollution in major cities, especially in developing countries. It is estimated that over 1 million premature deaths can be attributed to urban ambient air pollution.1 This has severe economic and health impacts, particularly for young children. We therefore propose that the post-2015 framework include an indicator tracking the mean urban air pollution of particulate matter.
PM10 is the concentration of particles with a diameter equal to or greater than 10 microns (μ), which are usually produced from construction and mechanical activities, while PM2.5 is the concentration of particles with a diameter equal to or greater than 2.5 microns, usually produced from combustion. These smaller particles are actually more damaging as they permeate the lung more deeply. WHO has set guidelines for PM10 at 20 μg/m3 annual mean and 50 μg/m3 24-hour mean and for PM2.5 at 10 μg/m3 annual mean and 25 μg/m3 24-hour mean.2 However, many cities regularly experience concentrations over 10 times higher than these recommendations.",,,,By city and province.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many countries track the concentration of PM10 (i.e. particles with a diameter equal to or greater than 10 microns) and PM2.5 (diameter equal to or greater than 2.5 microns) for large cities and report this data to WHO.

Complementary indicators include population-based measures, such as “percentage of population whose exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 is above certain μg/m3 (i.e. 15) threshold,” which can provide city authorities with important information on how to direct policies to lower the health impact of air pollution.",,,,,,

Goal,, Percentage of urban solid waste regularly collected and well managed,Data on formal solid waste collection and management may be available from municipal bodies and/or private contractors. Informal collection data may be available from NGOs and community organizations.,,,,"Urban households and businesses produce substantial amounts of solid waste (not including industrial, construction, and hazardous waste) that must be collected regularly and disposed of properly in order to maintain healthy and sanitary living conditions. Such collection can be through formal or informal means. Uncollected and improperly managed solid waste can end up in drains and dumps, and may result in blocked drains and other unsanitary conditions. Mosquitoes that spread disease can breed in blocked drains and dumps. In addition, some constituents of solid waste, such as organic matter, can attract flies and rodents that spread gastrointestinal and parasitic diseases.
Sustainable solid waste management is essential. This implies waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, incineration, and disposal in landfills. Waste reduction, recycling, reuse and composting are preferred methods and should be promoted, as they reduce demand on scarce environmental resources, decrease energy use, and minimize the quantity of waste that must eventually be incinerated or disposed of in landfills.
UN-Habitat has specified that solid waste collection can include (formal or informal) collection from individual households and regular dumpster collection, but not local dumps to which households must carry garbage.1 Solid waste collection should be considered regular and adequate if it occurs at least once a week.",,,,This indicator can be disaggregated at the city and town level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In many countries and sub-national governments, solid waste collection and management data are currently incomplete or not available.

Goal,, Disclosure of Natural Resource Rights Holdings,"Administrative data, international monitoring.",,,,"This indicator measures whether resource-based rights and registry of rights holders between governments and business, including contracts and licenses relating to extractive resource exploration and production, as well as agriculture and forestry operations, are published in a timely manner. Disclosure of rights and rights holders is an essential precondition to ensuring that all parties benefit from large-scale resource investments. Secrecy can be a convenient way to hide power imbalances, incompetence, mismanagement, and corruption. Disclosure is also a necessary precursor for the coordinated and effective management of the sector by government agencies. It also allows citizens to monitor rights in areas such as environmental compliance and the fulfillment of social commitments. Contract and rights transparency also provides incentives: government officials can be deterred from seeking their own interests over the population’s and, over time, governments can also increase their bargaining power by gauging contracts from around the world.1
This indicator measures whether resource-based rights between governments and business, including those related to extractive resource exploration and production as well as agriculture and forestry operations, are publicly published in a timely, free, and open manner. Based on the rating system of the proposed IMF Pillar IV on Resource Revenue transparency and to be included in the updated Resource Governance Index, the indicator would be constructed so that a government can receive one of four ratings:

100: The government maintains and publishes free and online an up-to-date register of all natural resource rights holders, the full texts of terms and conditions associated with their natural resource rights, and the beneficial owners of those rights.
67: The government maintains and publishes free and online an up-to-date register of all natural resource rights holders and the full text of terms and conditions associated with their natural resource rights.
33: The government maintains and publishes an up to-date register of all natural resource rights holdings. The government maintains and publishes an up-to-date register of all natural resource rights holders and their holdings.
0: No. Rights, a register of rights and rights holders are not published.

Goal,, Global Food Loss Indicator [or other indicator to be developed to track the share of food lost or wasted in the value chain after harvest],Administrative data.,,,,"Food losses through inefficiencies in the food production chain and waste are widespread in all countries. At present, direct data on food losses and waste is sparse and difficult to compare internationally. This is partly explained by the high cost of directly measuring losses and waste for numerous categories of food products and across different stages from harvest to final consumption. In view of the importance of food losses and waste, a basic indicator is needed to track progress over time. FAO is currently developing the Global Food Loss Indicator, which is expected to be available by end of 2015 but remains to be validated. The indicator is based on a model using observed variables that conceivably influence food losses (e.g. road density, weather, pests) to estimate quantitative pre- and post-harvest losses. Data on these variables are available from several sources, including country statistics, FAOSTAT, WFP’s Logistics Capacity index, World Road Statistics, etc. In addition, depending on their priorities and monitoring systems, countries may adopt other indicators to more directly track food losses and/or waste for agricultural product categories of highest priority to their food and nutrition security.1",,,,Opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed once the indicator has been defined.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Significant efforts will be necessary to create a baseline for food loss and waste. Staple crops that are often combined after harvest for processing will usually provide better data for food loss. Crops grown on a small scale and/or consumed directly by the household farm will be much more difficult to assess, yet they are the crops that tend to experience the highest food losses.",,,,,,

Goal,, [Share of companies valued at more than [$1 billion] that publish integrated monitoring] – to be developed,International monitoring.,,,,"Today, most companies report only on their financial results without regard to their social and environmental impacts. As a result their investors may not be aware of their full risk exposure. Likewise, society does not know a company’s contribution to sustainable development. Several integrated monitoring standards have been developed that track the social and environmental externalities of businesses. One prominent example is the International Integrated Monitoring Council (IISC). We propose that an indicator be created to track the percentage of large companies (i.e. larger than [US$1 billion, measured in PPP]) that prepare integrated reports that are consistent with the SDGs and conform to standards that would need to be defined.",,,,"This indicator can be disaggregated by sector of activity, ownership (listed vs. privately held or public companies), and other characteristics (including location).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The standards and methodologies tracked by this indicator need to be defined.

Goal,," CO2 intensity of new power generation capacity installed (gCO2 per kWh), and of new cars (gCO2/pkm) and trucks (gCO2/tkm)","UNFCCC, IEA.1
For example, see OECD (2008). Greenhouse Gas Reduction Strategies in the Transport Sector: Preliminary Report.",,,,"The generation of electricity from the power sector and the consumption of fuel in the transport sector are responsible for a large share of total global GHG emissions. Ultimately, to achieve the levels of emissions reductions necessary to limit the global temperature increase to 2°C or below, the power and transport sectors need to dramatically reduce the emissions associated with the provision of these energy services. Tracking the evolution of the CO2 intensity of new additions to these sectors is therefore important to assess how these sectors are evolving based on market conditions and policy frameworks in each country.
The proposed power sector indicator is defined as the amount (measured in grams) of CO2 emissions per unit of generated electricity (measured in kilowatt-hour) from new capacities installed (between two dates of measurement of the indicator).
The proposed transport indicators are defined as the amount (measured in grams) of CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer travelled (pkm) for new cars, and per ton kilometer travelled (tkm) for new trucks (between two dates of measurement of the indicator).
For the transport sector, changes in activity levels are key drivers of the increase in transport-related CO2 emissions globally, but absolute levels of transport-related CO2 emissions are linked to a country’s size, population, and level of economic activity. Measuring CO2 intensity of new cars for passenger transport and new trucks for freight transport allows for more relevant historic and cross-country comparisons, by giving an understanding of how well countries are evolving their vehicle fleets to carry out the transport task, based on a physical performance parameter. It should also be noted that emissions from international air and maritime transport are important sources of global emissions, but these sources are not easily attributable to a particular country.",,,,Opportunities for disaggregation to be reviewed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Transport activity is typically described by measuring vehicle kilometers (vkm) although such a measure does not allow for ready comparisons across modes or take into account varying load factors. It is also necessary to measure passenger kilometers (pkm) or ton kilometers (tkm) although these metrics require more detailed data collection.

Goal,," Net GHG emissions in the Agriculture, Forest and other Land Use (AFOLU) sector (tCO2e)",Administrative data.,,,,"This indicator is defined as total net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) – in the Agriculture, Forest and other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, broken down by gas (including CO2, N2O and CH4) and by land used category (including forest lands, croplands, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other lands), according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 guidelines for the national GHG inventory,1 and the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF).2
Inventory methods need to be practical and operational. For the AFOLU Sector, anthropogenic GHG and removals by sinks are defined as all those occurring on “managed land.” Managed land is land where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions. Emissions/removals of greenhouse gases do not need to be reported for unmanaged land. However, it is good practice for countries to quantify and track over time the area of unmanaged land so that consistency in area accounting is maintained as land-use change occurs.",,,,"By gas and land use category. In addition, they could also be expressed on a per ton of production basis because data on per unit land may lead to misleading conclusions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"As explained in the introduction of the IPCC 2006 guidelines for the national greenhouse gases inventory chapter 4 on AFOLU,3 the AFOLU sector has some unique characteristics with respect to developing inventory methods.

Goal,, Share of coastal and marine areas that are protected,Country monitoring.,,,,"Well-governed protected coastal and marine areas have proven effective in safeguarding species habitats and populations.1 Goal C of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) calls to “improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity.” In support of this, the CBD’s Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 aims to have at least 10% of coastal and marine areas protected by 2020.
The latest official statistics on marine protected areas (MPA) show that less than 3% of the global ocean is protected.2 Major efforts are required to meet Aichi Target 11 and particular emphasis is needed to protect critical ecosystems such as tropical coral reefs, seagrass beds, deepwater cold coral reefs, seamounts and coastal wetlands.3",,,,"Although mostly used at a global scale, the indicator is reported at the national level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A simple MPA percentage does not provide insight as to whether the protected area is being well managed or whether biodiversity is actually being secured.,,,,,,
Goal,, Percentage of fish tonnage landed within Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY),Administrative data from national production and international trade statistics.,,,,"MSY is the largest average yield (catch) that can theoretically be taken from a species’ stock over an indefinite period under constant environmental conditions. It is usually measured in tons.1 This indicator provides information on the degree of exploitation of fishery resources and the progress towards sustainable management of fisheries. The UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, the Plan of Implementation of the 2001 World Summit on Sustainable Development, and the CBD, among others, all refer to MSY-based reference points and targets.2
In the final declaration from Rio+20, states committed to take urgent measures to “maintain or restore all stocks at least to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY).”",,,,All UN Member states are asked to report their annual landings by fish species or species group to the FAO. Data quality varies from country to country with fishery landings data often reported by national governments in aggregated form rather than by fish species.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"One problematic aspect of the MSY is that it is calculated for a single species, ignoring the effects on or from other species. An alternative concept to the MSY is the Optimum Sustainable Yield (OSY) that also takes into account economic, social, and ecological factors such as job creation. The OSY can be either equal to or below the MSY. However, there is no agreement on a common definition of OSY.",,,,,,
Goal,, Annual change in forest area and land under cultivation (modified MDG Indicator),Remote sensing/satellite.,,,,"This indicator tracks the net change of forest area and the expansion of agriculture into natural ecosystems, as well as the loss of productive agricultural land to the growth of urban areas, industry, roads, and other uses, which may threaten a country’s food security. It is measured as a percentage change per year and tracked by FAO. Success would be reducing the loss of agricultural land to other uses (industry, urban areas), while also halting the conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture. Sustainable agroecological intensification would allow increased food production without converting natural ecosystems to agriculture.
Land under cultivation is defined by FAO as land under temporary crops (double-cropped areas are counted once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow.1 Forest area is land under natural or planted stands of trees, excluding tree stands in agricultural production systems (e.g. plantations or agroforestry systems) and trees in urban parks and gardens.",,,,"This indicator can be disaggregated spatially.

Goal,, Area of forest under sustainable forest management as a percent of forest area,Administrative data.,,,,The indicators on annual change in forest area and on protected areas overlay with biodiversity provide important information on the change in forest area and the protection of key forest regions. A third forest-related indicator is needed to track the sustainability of economic and other uses of forests. The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2010 has proposed this indicator measuring the percentage of forest under sustainable management.1,,,,Countries with strong forest management systems can disaggregate the indicator spatially.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A challenge for this indicator is to arrive at an internationally consistent definition of sustainable forest management practices.2 An improved version of the indicator and underlying data will be provided in the 2015 assessment of Global Objectives on Forests.,,,,,,

Investments in remote sensing, digital mapping, and monitoring will be crucial to this effort. It is important to note that despite the FAO definition, there is no single measure or approach to measuring land degradation.",,,,,,
Goal,, Red List Index,A,,,,"The Red List Index (RLI), drawing on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, tracks the rate of extinction for marine and terrestrial species groups in the near future (i.e. 10-50 years) in the absence of any conservation action.1 A downward trend in the index implies that the risk of a species’ extinction is rising. The RLI is used to measure progress towards the Aichi Target 12 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)2 and the Millennium Development Goals.
The IUCN Red List is the most respected system to track the status of threatened species according to seven risk categories that range from “extinct” to “least concern.”3 The criteria for determining the risk status of each species are scientifically rigorous and easy to understand for the general public. The Red List Index is applicable to different major species groups, transparent, and can track trends over time.4 It has been developed for many major species groups, such as amphibians and birds, but important gaps remain, particularly among less well-studied major species groups, such as fungi. For species groups not yet covered by the RLI, a sampled approach can be used that is based on representative samples of species from taxonomic groups.5",,,,"By country and major species group, and for Internationally Traded Species. The RLI can also be disaggregated to regional and national levels, in particular via National Red Lists.6 We recommend that national and global RLIs be reported by key species group. In the case of smaller countries that cover contiguous marine or terrestrial biomes, it may be more appropriate to report regional RLI by key species group.
We propose that the RLI also be applied to internationally traded terrestrial and marine species including those identified in appendices I and II of the Convention on Internationally Traded and Endangered Species (CITES).7 The RLI for Internationally Traded Species will track the near-term extinction risk for species that are subject to international trade and whose survival is therefore heavily affected by non-host countries and cooperative international strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Red List Index is a composite index comprising a large number of underlying variables. At first sight it might therefore fall foul of a general preference against composite indices. However, the underlying data for the Red List Index is collected and analyzed by one organization and therefore does not impose any additional burden on NSOs. In view of this fact and the very widespread use of this index its inclusion in an SDG indicator framework strikes us as sensible.",,,,,,
Goal,, Protected areas overlay with biodiversity,International monitoring.,,,,"Terrestrial and marine protected areas are an important means of securing biodiversity and are therefore tracked under the Aichi targets. Yet, the global protected area system does not yet cover a representative sample of the world’s biodiversity, nor is it effectively targeted at the most important sites for biodiversity. For this reason Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) places emphasis on the development of ecologically representative protected area systems and the protection of areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services.1 This indicator, developed by BirdLife International and IUCN for UNEP-WCMC (the world conservation monitoring center), measures progress towards these elements of Target 11.
The indicator is a composite of three sub indicators: (i) the degree of protection of terrestrial and marine ecoregions of the world; (ii) the degree of protection of Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs); and (iii) the degree of protection of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (AZEs). The sub indicators are calculated based on overlays of ecoregions, IBAs and AZEs with all designated protected areas recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) with a known size. The WDPA is the most comprehensive global spatial dataset on marine and terrestrial protected areas available. The methodology used to create a global protected areas layer from the WDPA follows the one used to calculate the protected area coverage indicator.",,,,"Although mostly used at a global scale, the indicator can be calculated for regions, countries, or even biomes,2 and we recommend that such national-level monitoring become a priority under the post-2015 agenda. In the case of smaller countries covering contiguous ecoregions, a regional representation of this indicator may be more appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The indicator can be used to assess the status of protection and trends in protection over time. It can be widely applied at various scales to measure policy responses to biodiversity loss. UNEP-WCMC is working closely with the Alliance for Zero Extinction and BirdLife International to further improve the datasets and methodology used to calculate the IBA and AZE Protection Indices.3
The indicator is more complex than the original MDG Indicator, but it provides much richer information on the state of biodiversity in countries. A simplified and non-composite index for the coverage of protected areas can be derived by focusing only on the first component. This Ecoregion Protection Indicator would represent a weighted average of the percentage attainment of the Aichi target of protecting 17% of terrestrial systems and inland waters, and protecting 10% of marine and coastal areas. Marine protected areas (MPA) are measured as the percentage of a country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) that is under protection4 and is reported under the Marine Protected Areas Database (WDPA).5 Like the Aichi target, each component of the proposed index is measured separately and capped at 100% so that the greater protection of one terrestrial ecoregion will not compensate for the insufficient protection of another system.
While using the coverage of protected areas would simplify the task of countries regarding the collection of data, this indicator would fail to provide information on the effectiveness of the management of the protected area. Moreover, a percentage of protected area does not provide any insights on whether the area protected is critical for securing regional biodiversity.",,,,,,

In addition, the intentional homicide rate should be reported separately from the deaths due to armed conflict.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Death rates can have just as much to do with access and quality of health care as it does with the level of violence. Tracking injuries helps overcome this limitation. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) gathers annual statistical data on intentional homicide1 and WHO collects data on injuries. However, few countries actually report and the reliability of the national data may vary, especially for those countries afflicted with conflict. A real push for better data must be made.

Goal,," Revenues, expenditures, and financing of all central government entities are presented on a gross basis in public budget documentation and authorized by the legislature",Administrative data and international monitoring.,,,,"L￼ack of fiscal transparency weakens government accountability and increases ￼￼opportunities for corruption or poor management, ultimately undermining progress towards the SDGs. ￼Government revenues and budgets are often difficult for stakeholders to track. Increasingly, however, fiscal transparency has become the norm, bolstered by international standards like the recently updated IMF Guide on Fiscal Transparency.1 Transparency strengthens the opportunities for public oversight by allowing for public engagement in budgeting processes and for public scrutiny of discrepancies. These discrepancies can exist between revenue and expenditure data, as well as other published data including payments by companies and corporate tax disclosures. Public scrutiny can help identify both national discrepancies as well as intentional discrepancies, caused, for instance, by Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) and illicit flows. This is particularly important in the context of natural resource revenues, which present greater risks of mismanagement and corruption, as recognized by Pillar IV of the IMF Fiscal Transparency code, which focuses on Resource Revenue Management. Importantly, budget transparency will facilitate tracking of domestic resource mobilization and expenditures towards the SDGs.
This indicator, based on Pillars II and IV of the IMF Fiscal Transparency Code, measures the timely publication of revenues, expenditures, and financing of all central government entities, and that this data is presented on a gross basis in public budget documentation and authorized by the legislature. Revenues include taxes, royalties, dividends, bonuses, license fees, payments for infrastructure improvements, payments in kind, or any other significant payment and material benefit.2 Importantly, “expenditures” refers to all expenditures, including off-budget expenditures, which is particularly important with natural resource revenues, which are often not allocated through the national budget. This indicator also includes monitoring on the use of fuel subsidies, which can be a large extra-budgetary expenditure in a number of countries.
This indicator would track the publication of all revenues and expenditures as follows:

100: Public budget documentation incorporates all gross domestic and external revenues, expenditures, including off-budget and tax expenditures (including fuel subsidies), financing by central government ministries, agencies, extra-budgetary funds, and social security funds. Government also reports on resource revenue collections by project;

One of the most widely used measures of evaluative wellbeing is the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale, which is included in Gallup’s World Poll of more than 150 countries, representing more than 98% of the world’s population. It asks respondents to imagine a ladder with steps numbered 0 (bottom) to 10 (top), with 10 representing the best possible life for you ￼ and 0 the worst. Respondents then respond with which step they feel they are currently on, and where they will be in 5 years.1
The Cantril Scale measures how individuals evaluate their own lives, and is complemented by the positive affect measure of “Positive Mood,” which measures the ups and downs of daily emotions. Positive affect specifically measures a range of recent positive emotions. Although short-term emotional reports carry much less information about life circumstances than do life evaluations, they are very useful at revealing the nature and possible causes of changes in moods on an hour-by-hour or day-by- day basis.2",,,,"By sex, age, and geography (urban/rural, region).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To be reviewed.,,,,,,
